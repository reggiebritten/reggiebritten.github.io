<h2 id="group-rolls">Group Rolls</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you and your allies will make one roll that represents your success as a group. If the task is one where having multiple people is helpful, like searching a room, then you can use the highest TN of anyone in your group to determine your success. However, if having multiple people might hinder the task, like sneaking around, use the lowest TN of anyone in the group.</p>

<p>If any character participating in the roll has relevant tools, <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#background">backgrounds</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#bonds">bonds</a>, you can add those to the highest or lowest ability or personal of anyone in the group to determine your group’s total TN and boons. As normal, multiple background or bonds can all contribute to your sucess.</p>

<p>Once you’ve determined the TN and any boons or banes, make one roll using these numbers to determine the outcome for your entire group.</p>
