<h2 id="push-your-luck">Push Your Luck</h2>

<p>By throwing caution to the wind and fulling committing to your plan, you can push your luck! This gives your roll a boon, but imposes a -2 penalty to the roll’s TN. Failure becomes more likely and a normal success less likely, but the total of your roll increases and a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#critical-effects">critical effect</a> becomes possible. Pushing your luck is most useful when your TN is already high. You can only push your luck once per roll, and you can’t push your luck on a yielded <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> roll.</p>
