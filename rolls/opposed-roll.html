<h2 id="opposed-rolls">Opposed Rolls</h2>

<p>When another character would oppose your roll, then the GM will decide which of their abilities or personal values would pose the greatest challenge to you. That is used to set the difficulty of the roll, according to the table below. If your adversary has training that would help them oppose you, then the TN of your roll is penalized by -2.
