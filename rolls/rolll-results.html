<h2 id="roll-results">Roll Results</h2>

<p>Roll two dice of the size set by the GM to determine the outcome of a roll. For each of the dice that comes up less than or equal to your TN, you earn one success! Count up the number of successes; each one improves the result of the roll.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If zero dice succeed, then the roll is a failure. Not only have you failed to accomplish your goal, but you also suffer a <strong>setback</strong> determined by the GM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your earn exactly one success, then you have achieved a mixed result. You might accomplish your goal, but suffer a <strong>setback</strong>. You might fail at your main goal, but achieve something else of value. Or you might simply make no progress and be forced to try again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If at least two dice succeed, you have accomplished you goal! Things have gone as you planned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boon</a> gives you three or more dice, then the third successful die and each one after that earns you a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#critical-effects">critical effect</a>! The GM will describe the extraordinary effect your roll has earned. When your enemies’ rolls earn critical effects, they will cause you to suffer <strong>setbacks</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setbacks">Setbacks</h3>
<p>A setback resulting from a failure, mixed result, or enemy critical will cause a problem for you. The consequences will be relevant to what you were attempting and what stakes had been set. Some example setbacks might involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You or an ally involved suffer <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>, usually 1-3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You attract unwanted attention or waste time, generating a point of <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">condition</a> determined by the GM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of your resources or equipment become lost or <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#damaged">damaged</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You lose your window of opportunity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="critical-effects">Critical Effects</h3>
<p>You roll earns a critical effect for the third die that succeeds against the roll’s TN, and each successful die after that. Notice that it is only possible to earn critical effects if your roll has a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boon</a>, so seek out such advantages whenever you can! When you earn a critical effect, the GM will determine a positive outcome above and beyond normal success. Truly extraordinary critical effects can even be the stuff that <a class = "keyword" href="legends.html">legends</a> are made of.</p>

<h3 id="total">Total</h3>
<p>When your goal might take more than one roll to finish, the GM will consider the total of all the dice added together. Add your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html">ability</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#personal-values">value</a>, as well as any relevant training or tool, to the total of the roll. The GM will use this total to determine the amount of progress you make toward your goal, such as the amount of damage done by your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack’s</a> <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a>, or how far you can move in one round. Notice that rolling lower on a die is more likely to avoid setbacks, but rolling higher will get you more progress. You can do something carefully, or do it quickly, but not both at once.</p>
