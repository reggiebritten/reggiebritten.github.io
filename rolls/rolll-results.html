<h2 id="roll-results">Roll Results</h2>

<p>Roll two dice of the size set by the GM to determine the outcome of a roll. For each of the dice that comes up less than or equal to your TN, you earn one success! Count up the number of successes; each one improves the result of the roll.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If zero dice succeed, then the roll is a failure. Not only have you failed to accomplish your goal, but you also suffer a <strong>setback</strong> determined by the GM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your earn exactly one success, then you have achieved a mixed result. You might accomplish your goal, but suffer a <strong>setback</strong>. You might fail at your main goal, but achieve something else of value. Or you might simply make no progress and be forced to try again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If at least two dice succeed, you have accomplished you goal! Things have gone as you planned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boon</a> gives you three or more dice, then the third successful die and each one after that earns you a fated effect! For each fated effect you earn, you may invoke a <a class = "keyword" href="fate.html#twists-of-fate">twist of fate</a> without spending a fate point. However, the detail added to the world must be somehow related to the nature of the roll, as determined by the GM. When your enemies’ rolls earn fated effects, they will cause you to suffer a <strong>setback</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A setback resulting from a failed or mixed roll will cause a problem for you. The GM will make the consequences relevant to what you were attempting and what stakes had been set. Some more generic setbacks might involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You suffer <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>, usually 1-3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">condition</a> determined by the GM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You attract unwanted attention and/or generate a point of <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes much more time than expected, possibly leading to <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of your resources or equipment become lost or <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#damaged">damaged</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You lose your window of opportunity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When your goal might take more than one roll to finish, the GM will consider the total of all the dice added together. Add your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html">ability</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#personal-values">value</a>, as well as any relevant training or tool, to the total of the roll. The GM will use this total to determine the amount of progress you make toward your goal, such as the amount of damage done by your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack’s</a> <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a>, or how far you can move in one round. Notice that rolling lower on a die is more likely to avoid setbacks, but rolling higher will get you more progress. You can do something carefully, or do it quickly, but not both at once.</p>

<p>The <a class = "keyword" href="wip.html#game-running/action-resolution">action resolution</a> section has more details on setbacks, mixed results, fated effects, and how you might use the total of a roll.</p>
