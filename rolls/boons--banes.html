<h2 id="boons--banes">Boons &amp; Banes</h2>

<p>Boons and banes represent a character’s expertise and unusual circumstances that help or hinder a roll. For each boon that a roll has, roll one additional die of the same size. It counts just like the other dice for determining the success of the roll, and the roll’s total. Furthermore, if three or more dice succeed, then the roll is fated!  Not only has it succeeded, you can also invoke a twist of fate for free!</p>

<p>Each bane that you suffer takes away one of your dice for the roll. A roll with only one bane forces you to roll one one die, and a roll with two banes takes away both your dice, making failure inevitable! Boons can add dice to rolls that have banes, canceling them out, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>If you have expertise that will help with the roll, then it gives you a boon! Any background details that would hinder your roll impose a bane, but also grant you a point of fate for your trouble.</p>
