<h2 id="boons--banes">Boons &amp; Banes</h2>

<p>Boons and banes represent your character’s <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#bonds">bonds</a>, features of the game world, or the actions of other characters that help or hinder a roll. The GM will also award you a boon if you come up with a very clever plan, or impose a bane if you plan has a major flaw. For each boon that you’ve earned, roll one additional die of the same size as the rest of the dice in the roll. It counts just like the other dice for determining the success of the roll and the roll’s total. Furthermore, if three or more dice succeed, then the roll is a critical success!  Not only has the roll succeeded, your roll has earned a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#critical-effects">critical effect</a> that the GM will describe.</p>

<p>Each bane that you suffer takes away one of your dice for the roll. A roll with only one bane forces you to roll one one die, and a roll with two banes takes away both your dice, making failure inevitable! Each bane cancels out with one boon your roll has, and vice-versa.</p>
