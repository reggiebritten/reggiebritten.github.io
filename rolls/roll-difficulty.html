<h2 id="roll-difficulty">Roll Difficulty</h2>

<p>The GM will assign each roll a a dice size based on the task’s difficulty. The dice size is determined by considering how easy the task would be for a normal person under normal circumstances, including any strategy they are using. The dice size should not take into account a character’s proficiency at the task, the tool’s they use, or unusual circumstances; those are represented as bonuses or penalties to the roll. The GM may decide that some rolls are impossible unless you have the right training or tools.</p>
