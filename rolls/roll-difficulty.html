<h2 id="roll-difficulty">Roll Difficulty</h2>

<p>The GM will assign each roll a a dice size based on the task’s difficulty. The dice size is determined by considering how easy the task would be for a normal person under normal circumstances, including any strategy you are using. The dice size doesn’t depend on your proficiency at the task, the tools you use, or unusual circumstances; those are represented as bonuses or penalties to the roll. The GM may decide that some rolls are impossible unless you have the right training or tools.</p>

<h3 id="opposed-rolls">Opposed Rolls</h3>

<p>When another character would oppose your roll, then the GM will decide which of their abilities or personal values would pose the greatest challenge to you. That is used to set the difficulty of the roll, according to the table below. If your adversary has training that would help them oppose you, then the TN of your roll is penalized by -2. If you don’t have information about your adversary, the GM might not tell you what size dice you will roll until you commit to making the roll.</p>
