<h2 id="group-rolls">Group Rolls</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you and your allies will make one roll that represents your success as a group. If the task is one where having multiple people is helpful, like searching a room, then you can use the highest TN of anyone in your group to determine your success. However, if having multiple people might hinder the task, like sneaking around, use the lowest TN of anyone in the group.
Consider each character’s training when determining who has the highest or lowest bonus, but you can’t share your training with others. On the other hand, each character with relevant expertise can contribute a boon to the check, no mater whose TN you use. Once you’ve determined the TN and any boons or banes, make one roll using these numbers to determine the outcome for your entire group.</p>
