<h2 id="play-it-safe">Play it Safe</h2>

<p>You can choose to play is safe before a roll, giving you a +2 bonus to the roll’s TN, but imposing a bane on the roll. This makes complete success impossible, but reduces the chances of total failure, likely resulting a mixed success. Playing it safe is most useful when your TN for the roll is low. You can only play it safe once per roll, and you can’t play it safe on a yield roll.</p>
