<h2 id="play-it-safe">Play it Safe</h2>

<p>By executing your plan slowly and methodically, you can play it safe on your roll. This gives you a +2 bonus to the roll’s TN, but imposes a bane on the roll. Complete success becomes impossible without help, but the chances of total failure diminish, likely resulting a mixed success. Playing it safe is most useful when your TN for the roll is low. You can only play it safe once per roll, and you can’t play it safe on a yield roll.</p>
