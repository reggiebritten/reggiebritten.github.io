<h3 id="critical-effects">Critical Effects</h3>
<p>You roll earns a critical effect for the third die that succeeds against the roll’s TN, and each successful die after that. Notice that it is normally only possible to earn critical effects if your roll has a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boon</a>, so seek out such advantages whenever you can! Another way to earn critical effects is when defeating your enemies. Each of your dice that you didn’t use to defeat an enemy earns you a critical effect, regardless of what those dice rolled. <br />
When you earn a critical effect, the GM will determine a positive outcome above and beyond normal success. Truly extraordinary critical effects can even be the stuff that <a class = "keyword" href="legends.html">legends</a> are made of.</p>
