<h3 id="total">Total</h3>
<p>When your goal might take more than one roll to finish, the GM will consider the total of all the dice added together. Add your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html">ability</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#personal-values">value</a>, as well as any relevant training or tool, to the total of the roll. The GM will use this total to determine the amount of progress you make toward your goal, such as the amount of damage done by your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attackâ€™s</a> <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a>, or how far you can move in one round. Notice that rolling lower on a die is more likely to avoid setbacks, but rolling higher will get you more progress. You can do something carefully, or do it quickly, but not both at once.</p>
