<h2 id="push-your-luck">Push Your Luck</h2>

<p>You can choose to push your luck before a roll, giving your roll a boon, but imposing a -2 penalty to the roll’s TN. This makes failure more likely and a normal success less likely, but improves the total of your roll and makes a fated effect possible. Pushing your luck is most useful when your TN is already high. You can only push your luck once per roll, and you can’t push your luck on a yield roll.</p>
