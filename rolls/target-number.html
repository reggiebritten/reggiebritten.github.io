<h2 id="target-number">Target Number</h2>

<p>The target number, or TN, of a roll is based on the roll’s type. For example, if the GM asks for a brawn roll, and your brawn is 3, then 3 is the TN for the roll. The higher your TN is, the better your odds of success. If you have any <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#background">backgrounds</a> that will help with the roll, then each increases the roll’s TN by +2. <br />
The tools you use can also give you a bonus to your TN. If you have a tool that is well suited for the task - beyond the bare minimum needed to attempt it - you gain a +1 bonus to your TN. If it is precisely the right tool for the job, it gives you a +2 instead. The GM might also determine that a particularly bad tool imposes a -1 penalty to your TN.</p>
