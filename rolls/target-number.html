<h2 id="target-number">Target Number</h2>

<p>The target number, or TN, of a roll is based on the roll’s type. For example, if the GM asks for a brawn roll, and your brawn is 3, then 3 is the TN for the roll. The higher your TN is, the better your odds of success. If you have training that will help with the roll, then your training increases the roll’s TN by +2. Likewise, you might have tools that will give you a bonus to your TN. Multiple tools can boost your TN, but only one source of training can help at a time.</p>
