<h3 id="major-effects">Major Effects</h3>

<p>Major effects are the most important part of legendary items, and the things for which such items will be renowned. Many major effects will take the form of powerful <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skills</a>. They may be combat abilities or be valuable for exploration and interaction. They may be passive skills that are always in effect, skills that must be recovered between uses, or powerful skills that can only ever be used once.</p>

<p>You must decide the nature or essence of the legendary item’s effects, and the GM will decide the specific powers and limitations based on the your decisions. The effects of the item must be closely tied to legendary deed that creates them, such that the connection between the events of the legendary deed and the effects of the item is clear and obvious to anyone who is told. If one character stands out in the events of legendary deed, their opinion should be held in higher regard. But ultimately, a legend tells the story of your whole group. If you aren’t satisfied with the GM’s decision, you may continue the discussion until you come up with something that is agreeable to everyone. Some examples of major effect include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Attacks with the item may gain the <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#fire">fire</a> tag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item may be used to cause plants in the area to grow rapidly and <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#restrained">restrain</a> foes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item may be used to reveal things that otherwise could not be seen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item grants <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#immune">immunity</a> to a specific <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">condition</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item instantly returns to its owner’s hand when commanded.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
