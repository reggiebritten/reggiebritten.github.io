<h2 id="legends-of-old">Legends of Old</h2>

<p>Not all legends you encounter will be forged by you or your allies. Many legends have left their mark on the world already. All legendary items are the symbols for legendary deeds of the past and have effects that reflect those epic histories.</p>

<p>Legendary items are memorable by their very nature, and it is obvious to anyone if a particular item has a legendary past. However the name and effects of an item are not always obvious. Holding and meditating upon an unknown legendary item for one minute imparts a vague knowledge of the legendary deed that created it. But you must often deduce the effects of a legendary item by trial and error. Once you have discovered the legendary effects, the name and full history of the legendary item reveals itself to you.</p>
