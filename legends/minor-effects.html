<h3 id="minor-effects">Minor Effects</h3>

<p>Minor effects have little to no direct benefit, but instead symbolize the spirit and meaning of the legend. Minor effect may include aesthetic effects, slight convinces, or demonstrations of the item’s power. Minor effects should never grant skills. Some examples of minor effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The item glows with harmless fire at the bearer’s command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flowers blossom in the footsteps of the bearer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bearer’s eyes glow with power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item can never be damaged, tarnished, cracked, or ripped.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The owner can always sense their distance from the item.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
