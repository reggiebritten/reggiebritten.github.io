<h2 id="commemorating-legends">Commemorating Legends</h2>

<p>Once you have achieved a legendary deed, it must then be commemorated. This is a process of discussion between the players and the GM detailing how the legend should be remembered and expressed in the game. There are five details each legend must have to be commemorated: a <strong>major effect</strong>, a <strong>minor effect</strong>, a <strong>symbol</strong>, a <strong>name</strong>, and an <strong>inscription</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="major-effects">Major Effects</h3>

<p>Major effects are the most important part of legendary items, and the things for which such items will be renowned. Many major effects will take the form of powerful <a href="skills.html">skills</a>. They may be combat abilities or be valuable for exploration and interaction. They may be passive skills that are always in effect, skills that must be recovered between uses, or powerful skills that can only ever be used once.</p>

<p>You must decide the nature or essence of the legendary item’s effects, and the GM will decide the specific powers and limitations based on the your decisions. The effects of the item must be closely tied to legendary deed that creates them, such that the connection between the events of the legendary deed and the effects of the item is clear and obvious to anyone who is told. If one character stands out in the events of legendary deed, their opinion should be held in higher regard. But ultimately, a legend tells the story of your whole group. If you aren’t satisfied with the GM’s decision, you may continue the discussion until you come up with something that is agreeable to everyone. Some examples of major effect include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Attacks with the item may gain the <a href="skills.html#fire">fire</a> tag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item may be used to cause plants in the area to grow rapidly and <a href="conditions.html#restrained">restrain</a> foes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item may be used to reveal things that otherwise could not be seen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item grants <a href="skills.html#immune">immunity</a> to a specific <a href="conditions.html">condition</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item instantly returns to its owner’s hand when commanded.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="minor-effects">Minor Effects</h3>

<p>Minor effects have little to no direct benefit, but instead symbolize the spirit and meaning of the legend. Minor effect may include aesthetic effects, slight convinces, or demonstrations of the item’s power. Minor effects should never grant skills. Some examples of minor effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The item glows with harmless fire at the bearer’s command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flowers blossom in the footsteps of the bearer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bearer’s eyes glow with power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The item can never be damaged, tarnished, cracked, or ripped.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The owner can always sense their distance from the item.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="symbol">Symbol</h3>

<p>The symbol of the legend is a physical object that will bear the power of the legendary deed such, as a weapon, a piece of equipment, or some other item. Choosing an object closely tied to the events of the legendary deed may make the connection between deed and effects more obvious, allowing a broader range of effects. However, the symbol may also be unrelated to the events of the legendary deed.</p>

<p>Each object may only be the symbol for one legend at a time. One legend may be replaced by another on a specific symbol, but only if the two legends are related in a way that feels like one continuous story. For example, a wicked and evil blade may be redeemed by defeating the villain who tainted it.</p>

<h3 id="name">Name</h3>

<p>The name of the legend may be anything that your group chooses, but it should inspire memories of the people and events that created it. A unique and evocative name is a mandatory part of any legendary item.</p>

<h3 id="inscription">Inscription</h3>

<p>Finally, once the effects, symbol and name have been established, one character of the group’s choice may inscribe the legend. You must inscribe runes representing the name of the legend onto the chosen symbol over the course of a day’s work. Once you have finished inscribing the runes, the legend has been forged, and your new legendary item is ready to use!</p>
