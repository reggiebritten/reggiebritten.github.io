<h2 id="mounts--vehicles">Mounts &amp; Vehicles</h2>

<p>Mounts and vehicles, such as horses, wagons, and ships, make travel easier and more convenient over long distances.</p>

<p>With proper pack saddles, a donkey can carry 50 <a href="...html#equipment\bulk">bulk</a>, a horse, mule, or camel can carry 100 bulk,  and an ox can carry 150 bulk, not including a rider. A horse, mule, camel, or ox needs to eat five supplies per day, and a donkey eats one. However, these animals may be able to forage for food where grass is plentiful.</p>

<p>Mounts are also more comfortable, you suffer one less <a href="...html#stress">stress</a> per day from traveling through any terrain. However, mounted travel doesn’t protect against the effects of weather. Mounts themselves may become stressed and suffer afflictions if taken to extreme environments or not cared for. While many mounts are capable sprinters, they aren’t much faster over the course of a day. Mounts don’t increase your group’s overland travel speed under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>A wagon or carriage must be pulled by a beast of burden, and doubles the amount of bulk that beast can transport. You also suffer one less stress while riding on such a vehicle. However, wagons and carriages travel 5 mi / 8 km per day more slowly on roads, and 10 mi / 16 km more slowly where there isn’t a road.</p>

<p>Large sailing ships can travel around 100 mi / 160km per day, depending on their size and construction. Prevailing winds may increase or decrease this speed depending on their direction. You typically suffer one stress per day of travel aboard a large ship, though this might be increased by the weather. Large ships can carry tremendous amounts of goods.</p>
