<h2 id="travel-activities">Travel Activities</h2>

<p>While traveling, you can undertake additional activities that help you on your adventure. At the start of each day of travel, tell the GM which, if any, activity you will do while you travel. In particular, you should make sure you have a navigator unless you can follow clear landmarks like roads or rivers.</p>

<p>With the exception of navigators and trailblazers, your group can benefit from multiple characters participating in the same activity. Travel activities can adjust your speed, <a href="stress.html">stress</a>, <a href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>, and <a href="equipment.html#supplies">supplies</a> favorably or unfavorably depending on your success. So consider your priorities, strengths, and the landscape when deciding the best course of action. You are encouraged to use your <a href="personality.html#training">training</a>, any tools you have, and what you know about the terrain to aid with your travel activities.</p>

<p>Your activities will also determine your positions if a fight breaks out. Trailblazers and scouts will generally lead the way, with navigators close behind. Hunters and foragers will generally be to the side and a little off the beaten path looking for resources. Haulers, provisioners, and entertainers will generally be in the back taking care of supplies and allies.</p>

Tracking a creature or group is also considered navigating, and the GM will set the difficulty based on the landscape and your quarry. Success means you stay on course, while failure means you get lost. The GM will only describe what you see, hear, and know, so you must pay attention for signs that you might have gotten lost.
