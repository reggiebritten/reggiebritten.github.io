<h2 id="weather">Weather</h2>

<p>Weather and storms can slow your travels and make them more stressful. The GM will describe the weather in one of four terms: <strong>clear weather</strong>, <strong>foul weather</strong>, <strong>mild storm</strong>, and <strong>severe storm</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clear weather is a sunny or cloudy day with no precipitation, it has no effect on your travel speed or stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foul weather might be light rain or snow, or an an unseasonal heat wave or cold snap. Foul weather slows your travels for the day by 5 mi / 8 km, and inflicts an additional point of stress The right equipment might protect you from foul weather.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mild storm might describe a rainstorm, or a light blizzard or dust storm. Traveling during a mild storm is not recommended; your travels are slowed by 10 mi / 16 km, and you suffer five stress if you choose to travel that day. A mild storm imposes a <a href="rolls.html#boons--banes">bane</a> on all <a href="overland-travel.html#travel-activities">travel activities</a>; you might opt not to attempt any activities during a storm. Even if you’re not traveling, you will need to find shelter to wait out the storm if you want to avoid stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A severe storm is a thunderstorm, hurricane, or an extreme blizzard or dust storm. Travel is impossible, and any character exposed to the elements suffers one stress per hour. Some weather, like tornadoes and supernatural storms, may have even more immediate and dangerous consequences.</p>
