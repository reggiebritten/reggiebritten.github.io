Make an <a href="...html#abilities\agility">agility</a> <a href="...html#rolls">roll</a> based on the landscapeâ€™s <strong>fertility</strong>. You gain one <a href="...html#equipment\supplies">supply</a> for each of your successful dice. Failure means you attract unwanted attention and generate a point of <a href="...html#exploration\doom">doom</a>, although a successful scout can prevent this point of doom.
