<h1 id="personality">Personality</h1>

<p>A character’s personality describes many things including the way they see the world, the way they interact with other people, their life experience, their favorite pastimes, and what makes them special.</p>

<p>A character’s personality traits represent their outlook on life, determine how the respond to fateful deeds, and contribute to influence rolls made to persuade NPCs. A character’s background details describe their past experiences, which they draw upon to help overcome talent and influence rolls.</p>

<p>A character’s indulgences are activities they enjoy and that can reduce their stress. Finally, each character has a personal legend unique to them that gives them some special power.</p>

<h2 id="personality-traits">Personality Traits</h2>

<p>While all people have a unique set of values, principles, and motives, Forge of Legends focuses on six personality traits in particular. These personality traits come in three opposing pairs: bold vs. subtle, idealistic vs. pragmatic and serious vs. carefree.</p>

<p>Each character has a trait rating from zero to three in one trait from each pair. A rating of zero means the character has neither trait, while a rating of three is very strongly aligned with one trait and opposed to the other. Players may set their characters’ personality trait ratings to anything they wish when creating their character. But one set, personality traits typically only change as the results of fateful deeds, described below.</p>

<h3 id="bold--subtle">Bold / Subtle</h3>

<p>A bold character would confront an challenge directly, but a subtle character would bypass a direction confrontation. A bold character might see themself as brave, daring, and straightforward, while they see might subtle characters as cowardly, manipulative, or meek. A subtle character sees themself as patient, wise and careful, and bold characters as impatient, shortsighted, or reckless.</p>

<h3 id="idealistic--pragmatic">Idealistic / Pragmatic</h3>

<p>An idealistic character would renounce a beneficial but distasteful opportunity, but a pragmatic character would exploit such an opportunity. An idealistic character sees themself as honorable, fair, and someone who does the right thing, while they might see a pragmatic character as unscrupulous, selfish, or downright evil. A pragmatic character sees themselves as realistic, practical and someone who does what needs to be done, while they might describe an idealistic character as a zealot, a wishful thinker, or gullible.</p>

<h3 id="serious--carefree">Serious / Carefree</h3>

<p>A serious character would remain determined in the face of adversity, while a carefree character would adapt to their new situation. A serious character sees themself as tenacious, decisive, and calm, but might see a carefree character as unreliable, lazy, or overly excitable. A carefree character sees themself as friendly, flexible, and passionate, while they might see a serious character as dour, stubborn, and cold.</p>

<h2 id="fateful-deeds">Fateful Deeds</h2>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="optional-rule-focus-for-fateful-deeds">Optional Rule: Focus for Fateful Deeds</h3>

  <p>Performing a fateful deed aligned to one’s personality    can be inspiring and motivating. That resolve may just what is needed to    turn the tide of battle.    If your group wishes to use this rule, then whenever a    character performs a fateful deed matching their personality, that    character gains +8 focus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fateful deed is an important decision made in the spirit of one of the six personality traits. A fateful deed could be something a character says, does, or even doesn’t do, but it must always be a significant, informed, and voluntary choice by a character. The GM should attempt to let players know in advance when one of their actions will be considered a fateful deed, but fateful deeds may also be declared in hindsight if applicable. Players should also nominate each other’s actions for fateful deeds, but the GM makes the final decision.</p>

<p>When a choice is declared to be a fateful deed, the GM will specify which of the six personality traits most closely matches the situation. Any character involved in the deed should compare their personality traits to that specified by the GM. But characters who are unaware of or unable to influence the deed are not included.</p>

<p>If a character’s personality matches the trait of the fateful deed, then that character gains one point of fate (regardless of their trait rating). The character may also choose to increase the rating of that personality trait by one (up to three) or leave their trait rating unchanged.</p>

<p>If a character has a personality trait that is the opposite of the fateful deed, the character must choose one: either they suffer stress equal to their rating of the opposing trait; or the opposing trait rating is decreased by one. Sticking to one’s values can be difficult when the going gets tough.</p>

<h3 id="discussions">Discussions</h3>

<p>Discussions arise when a group of characters disagrees on a choice between two fateful deeds with opposite traits. A discussion is a chance for each character to state their viewpoints and what they believe to be the best choice for the situation. Each player should roleplay their character’s viewpoint and advocate for what their character would do.</p>

<p>Characters who participate in a discussion and share their perspectives are more willing to accept another character’s way of doing things. Whatever conclusion the group comes to regarding the fateful deed, characters who participated in the discussion suffer one less stress than normal as a result. A character with a trait rating a zero would not suffer any stress.</p>

<p>Player character will often need to persuade NPCs to assist them with their adventures. Sometimes, an NPC is eager and willing to do what they can. But when an NPC or group of NPCs is reluctant to help, influence rolls may change their perspective. The GM will call for an influence roll when a character attempts to change the mind of an NPC or group who is uncooperative.</p>

<p>First, the DM should consider the NPC or group’s objections, which describe why they are not willing to cooperate with the request. An objection could be that the NPC wants something in return, they fear the consequences of cooperating, or they just plain don’t like the character. If the NPC has no objections, then they would cooperate and no influence roll in needed.</p>

<p>Next the GM should decide the NPC’s patience, representing how long they will listen to the characters before refusing to listen more. An NPC’s patience will normally be about two but may change depending on the circumstances. Finally, the GM should decide the NPC’s personality traits or use traits that have already been established. The GM won’t reveal this information to the players right away, but the NPC’s words and actions will provide hints during the conversation.</p>

<p>The player’s goal with influence rolls are to overcome all the NPC’s objections before they run out of patience. The players should describe what their character says and does to persuade the NPC. Then the GM will decide which personality trait most closely matches the character’s words and actions, and assign the roll a target number for success, just like a talent roll.</p>

<p>If the character has the personality trait associated with the influence roll, they add their trait rating to the influence roll. But if they have the opposite trait, they subtract that rating from the roll instead. The same applies to the NPC or group being persuaded; if they share that trait, they add their rating to the character’s roll, but if they have the opposite trait, they subtract their rating from the roll instead.</p>

<p>As with talent rolls, players may add boons from relevant background details to their influence rolls, and the GM may add boons or banes based on the circumstances. Certain conditions, afflictions, and equipment can also increase or decrease influence rolls.</p>

<p>Group influence rolls also work like group talent rolls. Each character can contribute boons from their background details and nominate just one member of the group to roll the dice. Likewise, cooperating might force characters to take the lowest roll if their messages interfere with each other.</p>

<p>Finally, the chance die is rolled, and all bonuses and penalties are added. If the total is greater than the TN, then the character’s words and actions have successfully overcome that objection. If the roll fails, then the NPC is not convinced and loses one patience with the conversation.</p>

<p>Once all the NPC’s objections have been overcome, then their mind has been changed and they are willing to cooperate with the character’s request. Once the NPC’s patience runs out, they refuse to listen to anything further on the subject and insist on their current point of view.</p>

<p>The fate die is also rolled alongside an influence roll, and if it rolls a 1, doom may befall the players, while if it rolls a 10, the roll becomes fated.</p>

<p>For simple interactions with simple NPCs, the NPC might only have one objection and one patience, giving the players just one chance at success or failure. Only NPCs can be affected by influence rolls; players may always decide for themselves how their character thinks and reacts.</p>

<h3 id="changing-patience">Changing Patience</h3>

<p>Often when an NPC runs out of patience, that is the end of the conversation. However, character can attempt to increase an NPC’s patience by offering them new information relevant to the conversation.</p>

<p>For example, a guard may have run out of patience with the players simply asking to be let past. But if one of the players offers a generous bribe, the guard may be willing to reconsider their proposition. Other new information that may increase an NPC’s patience could include sharing a scandalous rumor, a previously unnoticed benefit for the NPC, or a threat against something important to them. Most importantly, whatever is brought up must be relevant to the conversation and new. If it is irrelevant or if the NPC has already been informed, then their patience does not increase.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, an NPC’s patience may decrease if they feel that they have been treated rudely or unfairly, or if they would rather avoid the subject of the conversation. Saying the wrong thing can end a conversation just as surely as a failed influence roll.</p>

<h2 id="background-details">Background Details</h2>

<p>A character’s background details describe the whole collection of experiences they have had over their life. This could include old and mundane information such as where a character was born and who their family is. But it can also include new and fantastic details such as recent adventures.</p>

<p>All these background details may become relevant for talent rolls and influence rolls, and lore checks. If a player believes that one or more of a character’s background details would provide them with valuable insight or experience toward a talent or influence roll, they should point the connection out to the GM. Even players who are not involved in the roll may point out how another character’s background is helpful in a given situation. The GM may ask the player how that experience is relevant, and if the GM agrees, then player may add a boon to their character’s roll.</p>

<p>Players should write down as much information about their character as they think is relevant, with the GM’s permission. However, it is okay if a player doesn’t have their character’s entire background detailed when the character is first created, because a character’s background can always be embellished.</p>

<h3 id="flaws--fate">Flaws &amp; Fate</h3>

<p>The characters of Forge of Legends are still just people, and often come with their own weakness, foibles, and flaws. But fate smiles upon those who admit their shortcomings.</p>

<p>​      A character’s flaws are background details just like any others. However, whenever a character flaws or other background details create a significant problem for the character or group, as determined by the GM, that character gains a point of fate. Characters with interesting flaws or double-edged background details will find more opportunities to be favored by fate.</p>

<h3 id="embellishing-a-background">Embellishing a Background</h3>

<p>At any time except during a roll, a character may ask to embellish their background by adding more details. This is a kind of twist of fate and follows all the same rules, such as only adding detail and not changing established facts.</p>

<p>Every character comes from somewhere and has done something. For characters with very few background details, adding modest details would be a likely or plausible twist of fate, costing few fate points. However, if a character already has some background details, or if they ask to add a detail that seems dubious or unrelated to their other details, then it may be an unlikely or doubtful twist of fate, requiring more fate points. Eventually the GM may declare that it is ridiculous or impossible, for a character to add dozens of unrelated details to their background.</p>

<p>In general, embellishing a character’s background is easier if fewer details have already been established, and if the detail being added is consistent with the background details that the character already has.</p>

<h2 id="lore">Lore</h2>

<p>Lore describes all the knowledge about various subjects a character has collected. When the GM or players ask if the characters have some specific knowledge about a subject, the GM will call for a lore check, and assign a lore rating necessary to reveal the information, based on the table below.</p>

<p>The players should review their characters’ backgrounds and point out any background detail that might be relevant to the subject. Each relevant background detail adds one to the group’s lore check on the subject.</p>

<p>If one or more characters have multiple similar background details, then only one should be counted to determine the group’s lore check. However, if different characters or different background details can offer different perspectives, then each one should be added to the group’s lore check.</p>

<p>Finally, the GM compare’s the group’s lore check to the necessary lore rating to reveal the information. If the group passes the check, then the GM reveals the information to them. No dice are rolled to determine what a character knows; either they have enough experience from their backgrounds, or they don’t.</p>

<p>If a character or group is revealed to have an insufficient lore rating, there are a few things they could do to increase their knowledge. They may try to seek out a person, book, or other source of information that can help them reach the required rating. Or they may ask to embellish their background to add a detail that would expand their knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="indulgences">Indulgences</h2>

<p>Indulgences are a character’s favorite activities, experiences, and pastimes. Each character should have three to five indulgences that describe what they like to do in their spare time. Whenever a character participates in one of their indulgences, they are relieved of one point of stress. An especially poignant indulgent experience may remove more than one stress or reward a character with a point of fate, at the GM’s discretion.</p>

<p>An indulgence should be a pleasant activity that is difficult, risky, costly, or otherwise rare but enjoyable for the character to do. For example, a sentiment such as “I like drinking a few ales” is not an indulgence, because it is not a rare experience. On the other hand, an indulgence such as “I like to get so drunk I have a hangover the next day” is fine because it comes with a downside.</p>

<p>Indulgences are only special if they are uncommon, and an old indulgence that becomes commonplace may no longer feel as special as it once did. Likewise, characters may discover new indulgences on their journey.</p>

<h2 id="personal-legend">Personal Legend</h2>

<p>A character’s personal legend is a story and power completely unique to them. A personal legend must include 3 things: An origin, a manifestation, and a mystery.</p>

<p>The origin is a brief description of how the character came to acquire or understand their personal legend. It may come from the character’s bloodline, one of their past deeds, or years of dedicated training. However, a personal legend is always tied to a character themselves, not an item that the character possesses.</p>

<p>The manifestation of a personal legend is a supernatural ability or power that the character has. As with Forging a Legend, describes below, the player should suggest the nature of the manifestation, while the GM should offer the specific effects and limitations. Both the player and the GM should agree on an appropriate manifestation. The GM Guidelines chapter includes additional information about manifestations.</p>

<p>Finally, ever personal legend needs a mystery. There may still be unanswered questions or unresolved conflicts about the origin, the character may not fully understand their manifestation, or there may be questions about the future of the personal legend.</p>

<p>Not all the details of a character’s personal legend need to be established right away. Personal legends can and do change over time. It may even be that a character hasn’t yet discovered their personal legend when the game begins. A character may only discover their personal legend in a moment of crisis.</p>
