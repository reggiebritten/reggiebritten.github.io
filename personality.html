  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, your <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#personal-legend">personal legend</a> is entirely unique to you and gives you some special power.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="personal-values">Personal Values</h2>

<p>While all people have a unique set of traits, principles, and motives, Forge of Legends focuses on six personal values in particular. These values come in three opposing pairs: bold vs. subtle, idealistic vs. pragmatic and serious vs. whimsical.</p>

<p>Your character has a rating from one to five in each value. A rating of one or two means that you are <strong>opposed</strong> to the value, while a rating of four or five means that you are <strong>aligned</strong> with the value. A rating of exactly three means you are <strong>neutral</strong> on that scale. Opposite pairs of values always add up to exactly 6; whenever one value is increased, the opposite value is decreased. If you have a bold rating of 3, you must also be subtle 3; if you are serious 5, you must be whimsical 1. Other than that restriction, you may set their characters’ personal values to anything you wish when creating your character.</p>

<p>Your personal values determine how you respond to <a class = "keyword" href="fate.html#fateful-deeds">fateful deeds</a>. You are rewarded with a fate point when you perform a fateful deed that is aligned with your values, but risk suffering <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a> when you perform a fateful deed opposed to your values. Fateful deeds are also the only way to change your values once you have set them.</p>

<p>Your personal values are also used for <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">rolls</a> you make to influence other NPCs (You can’t roll to influence other player characters). Such a roll will always be <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#opposed-rolls">opposed</a> by one of the NPC’s values, although the GM will determine which of those values will oppose you. For example, if you try to boldly intimidate a guard, the guard’s bold value will oppose you. The task is easier if the guard is subtle, and more difficult if they are bold. On the other hand, if you try to pragmatically bribe the guard, then the guard’s idealistic value will oppose you. The task is easier if the guard is more pragmatic like you, and more difficult if they are idealistic.</p>

<h3 id="bold-vs-subtle">Bold vs Subtle</h3>

<p>Bold and subtle describe a character’s approach to <strong>overcoming obstacles</strong>. A bold character would <strong>confront</strong> an challenge directly, but a subtle character would <strong>bypass</strong> a direction confrontation. A bold character might see themselves as brave, daring, and straightforward, while they see might subtle characters as cowardly, manipulative, or meek. A subtle character sees themselves as patient, wise, and careful, but bold characters as impatient, shortsighted, or reckless.</p>

<h3 id="idealistic-vs-pragmatic">Idealistic vs Pragmatic</h3>

<p>Idealistic and pragmatic describe how a character responds to <strong>unpleasant opportunities</strong>. An idealistic character would <strong>renounce</strong> a beneficial but distasteful opportunity, but a pragmatic character would <strong>exploit</strong> such an opportunity. An idealistic character sees themselves as honorable, fair, and someone who does the right thing, while they might see a pragmatic character as unscrupulous, selfish, or downright evil. A pragmatic character sees themselves as realistic, practical and someone who does what needs to be done, while they might describe an idealistic character as a zealot, a wishful thinker, or gullible.</p>

<h3 id="serious-vs-whimsical">Serious vs Whimsical</h3>

<p>Serious and Whimsical describe how a character responds to <strong>intriguing diversions</strong>. A serious character would <strong>persist</strong> toward their main objective, while a whimsical character would <strong>explore</strong> the new circumstance. A serious character sees themselves as tenacious, decisive, and calm, but might see a whimsical character as unreliable, lazy, or overly excitable. A whimsical character sees themselves as friendly, flexible, and passionate, while they might see a serious character as dour, stubborn, and cold.</p>

<h2 id="training-wip">Training <strong>WIP</strong></h2>

<p>Your training describes your familiarity with certain tasks, and benefits your <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">rolls</a> related to those tasks. When you create your character, select 7 tasks from the list below in which your character is trained. When the GM calls for a roll, you should ask if your training would help with the task. If the GM agrees that it would help, add a +2 bonus to your TN for the roll. Some tasks may only be attempted by a character who has the necessary training.</p>

<h2 id="expertise">Expertise</h2>

<p>Your expertise describes tasks at which you are uniquely excellent! If your expertise is relevant to a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a>, then it gives you a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boon</a> to that roll. If multiple sources of expertise are helpful, then you gain a boon for each! This mastery comes from the details of your history, such as where you are from, who you have known, and how you came to do what you’re doing now. You don’t decide your expertise when creating your character; your expertise is discovered through <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#flashbacks">flashbacks</a> as you play the game.</p>

<p>Expertise is not chosen from a specific list. Instead, expertise is a short phrase that describes your talent. Expertise much be specific enough that it doesn’t apply to just any situation, but general enough that it will be useful throughout your adventure. The GM will help you adjust your expertise to be appropriately specific, but a good guideline is that your expertise should include the name of a specific person, place, or thing.</p>

<p>For example, you might have expertise that you served aboard the SS Windsinger. That expertise would help you with anything related to the ship, including the crew, construction, and exploits of the ship. But such expertise wouldn’t help you with other different kinds of ships. Some example phrases of expertise are given here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve trekked every corner of the August Valley.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was swindled by the Merchant’s Guild, I’ll never let it happen again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court of Lataris recognizes me as a minor noble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Dust Dunes, you don’t survive if you can’t lay low.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Red Hand tribe of orcs killed my family; I’ll get my revenge.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flashbacks">Flashbacks</h3>

<p>A flashback is a chance to explore an important unanswered question about your character’s past. A flashback is triggered for you when another character is prompted by in-game events to ask you about your past. The question must come from a character other than yours, and it must be that character asking your character, not the player asking you as a player. NPCs, as well as your fellow player characters, can ask you questions that trigger a flashback. Furthermore, the question must be directly and clearly related to a recent in-game event, such as an NPC that was recently met, a location recently visited, or an item recently acquired or used. Out of the blue questions with no context to prompt them do not trigger flashbacks. You are free to ask the GM if a question has triggered a flashback, but the GM has the final say.</p>

<p>When the GM tells you that a question has triggered a flashback, imagine how your character’s past has led up to the recent events related to the question. You are free to suggest any connection you can imagine. The GM will determine if your proposed history conflicts with other elements of the game world. If there is no conflict, then your flashback becomes an established fact of your history! Write it down as <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#expertise">expertise</a> that you can call upon to aid you in your future adventures.</p>

<p>If you have a character trait in mind, one appropriate way to invite a flashback is to express it as a character <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#character-flaws">flaw</a> that poses an obstacle for you. Your allies might see you struggling, and ask what is troubling you. The GM will likely agree that this triggers a flashback, and you can explain the source of your difficulties. However, this will only work if your allies think to inquire about your flaw! If it doesn’t occur to anyone to ask, then there is no flashback. Keep an eye out for opportunities to ask your allies about their past so that they can earn flashbacks, and the will repay the favor!</p>

<h2 id="lore-checks">Lore Checks</h2>

<p>The GM will call for a lore check to determine what you know about a specific subject. If you have any training that would give you insight in the subject, each adds +2 to your lore check. If you have relevant expertise, each adds +4. If your allies have training or expertise that would offer a different perspective, you all can pool your knowledge together to determine how much you know. However, if you and your ally have the same training, it is only counted once for a lore check.</p>

<p>Once you’ve added up your relevant training and expertise, the GM will determine how much you know about the subject and tell you your insights. No dice are rolled to determine what you know; either you have enough experience from your background, or you don’t. If it turns out you don’t know enough lore, you’re encouraged to seek out people, books, or research activities to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="character-flaws">Character Flaws</h2>

<p>The characters of Forge of Legends are still just people, and often come with their own weakness, foibles, and flaws. But fate smiles upon those who admit their shortcomings. Whenever your character’s values, flaws or other personality features create a significant problem for you or your allies, you gain a point of fate. Characters with interesting flaws or double-edged quirks will find more opportunities to be favored by fate, and interesting flaws are likely to invite <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#flashbacks">flashbacks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="indulgences">Indulgences</h2>

<p>Indulgences are your character’s favorite activities, experiences, and pastimes. As you play the game you will discover your character’s indulgences, which will relive stress when you parted of them. An indulgence is a pleasant activity that is difficult, risky, costly, or otherwise rare but enjoyable for your character to do. Indulgences are only special if they are uncommon, and an old indulgence that becomes commonplace may no longer feel as special as it once did.</p>

<h2 id="personal-legend">Personal Legend</h2>

<p>Your character’s personal legend is a story and power completely unique to them! A personal legend must include 3 things: An origin, a manifestation, and a mystery. Not all the details of your personal legend need to be established right away. Personal legends can and do change over time. It may even be that a you haven’t yet discovered your personal legend when the game begins, only for it to be revealed later in a moment of crisis.</p>

<h3 id="origin">Origin</h3>

<p>The origin of your legend is a brief description of how you came to acquire or understand your personal legend. It may come from your bloodline, one of your past deeds, or years of dedicated training. However, a personal legend is always tied to your character themselves, not an item that your character possesses.</p>

<h3 id="manifestation">Manifestation</h3>

<p>The manifestation of a personal legend is a supernatural ability or power that your has, usually in the form of a unique skill. You should suggest the nature of the manifestation to the GM, who will then offer the specific effects and limitations. The GM Guidelines chapter includes additional information for designing legendary manifestations.</p>

<h3 id="mystery">Mystery</h3>

<p>Finally, every personal legend needs a mystery. There may still be unanswered questions or unresolved conflicts about the origin, you may not fully understand your manifestation, or you may be uncertain of how the legend will affect your future. A mystery is a loose thread that the GM can weave into an adventure. If the GM feels like it is difficult to incorporate your character’s mystery into any adventure, then they will ask you to elaborate that mystery.</p>

<p>By their nature, legendary mysteries entice characters to seek their answers. Discovering the resolution to a mystery rewards you with a new manifestation of your personal legend, which may enhance or even replace their old manifestation. Resolving a mystery doesn’t just spell the end of one chapter of your personal legend. It also marks the begging of another. Wherever you discover the answer to a mystery, the GM will work with you to decide what new mystery has arisen. A personal legend must always have some unanswered questions.</p>
