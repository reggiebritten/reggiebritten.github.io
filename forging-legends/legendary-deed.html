<h2 id="legendary-deeds">Legendary Deeds</h2>

<p>The first step toward forging a legend is achieving a legendary deed. A legendary deed is a feat that will be recounted and admired for countless generations to come. Whenever the player characters do something extraordinary, the GM may declare that they have achieved a legendary deed. There are many ways to accomplish a legendary deed, such as defeating a powerful foe, ingeniously overcoming an obstacle, or performing an amazing feat of skill. There are no limits on what could be considered a legendary deed, but the deed must be truly legendary - a tale worth retelling through the ages!
Some of the more common way to achieve a legendary deed are to defeat a legendary foe, such as a mighty dragon, or to succeed on a challenge of legendary difficulty.
Players should nominate the actions of other group members if their deeds seem suitably legendary. However, the GM may make the final decision. A legendary deed may not always be recognized right away. If the group comes to realize how incredible a past action truly was, the GM may declare the past action to be a legendary deed.</p>
