<h2 id="legendary-quests">Legendary Quests</h2>

<p>Many legendary deeds arise spontaneously out of heroic bravery, the demands of desperate situations, or just plain good luck. But some legendary items are created by grand aspirations and hard work. Legendary quests allow players to forge a specific legendary item of their choosing, but only after overcoming an appropriate adventure.
A player seeking to undertake a legendary quest should announce their intention to the GM. The player may describe any kind of legendary item they want, not merely one related to recent deeds. As with commemorating a legend, the GM and the player should come to an agreement on the item’s powers, effects, and limitations.
As part of this discussion, the GM should determine a legendary quest needed to earn this item. The legendary quest could be anything from a single encounter to an epic odyssey, as befitting the legendary item. But whatever the quest, it must be symbolically related to the effects of the legendary item it will create.
If the player does not accept the legendary quest that the GM requires, or if the GM can’t offer a suitable legendary quest at the time, then nothing happens. If the player does accept the legendary quest offered to them, then they should keep track of it and work toward it as best they can. Once legendary quest has been overcome, that completes the legendary deed needed to forge the chosen legend!
Each character may only undertake one legendary quest at a time. A character may abandon a legendary quest at any time, but doing so causes the character three stress. Giving up on one’s dreams is always disheartening.</p>
