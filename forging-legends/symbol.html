<h3 id="symbol">Symbol</h3>

<p>The symbol of the legend is a physical object that will bear the power of the legendary deed such as a weapon, a piece of equipment, or some other item. Choosing an object closely tied to the events of the legendary deed may make the connection between deed and effects more obvious, allowing a broader range of effects. However, the symbol may also be unrelated to the events of the legendary deed.
Each object may only be the symbol for one legend at a time. One legend may be replaced by another on a specific symbol, but only if the two legends are related in a way that feels like one continuous story. For example, a wicked and evil blade may be redeemed by defeating the villain who forged it.
If the chosen symbol is a weapon or other piece of equipment with existing skills, the legendary effects may replace one of the itemâ€™s skills. Legendary items take on a life of their own and are not strictly upgrades to existing items.</p>
