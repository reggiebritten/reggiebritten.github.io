<h3 id="major-effects">Major Effects</h3>

<p>Major effects are the most important part of legendary items, and the things for which such items will be renowned. Many major effects will take the form of powerful skills. They may be combat abilities or be valuable for exploration and interaction. They may be passive skills that are always in effect, skills that must be recovered between uses, or powerful skills that can only ever be used once.
The GM should decide on a suitable major effect based on the player’s suggestions. If the players aren’t satisfied with the GM’s decision, they may request different a major effect. But that too should be balanced by the GM. For balance guidelines, see the GM Guidelines chapter. Some examples of major effect include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attacks with the item may gain the fire tag.</li>
  <li>The item may be used to cause plants in the area to grow rapidly and restrain foes.</li>
  <li>The item may be used to reveal things that otherwise could not be seen.</li>
  <li>The item grants immunity to some specific condition.</li>
  <li>The item instantly returns to its owner’s hand when commanded.</li>
</ul>
