<h3 id="leg-injury-wip">Leg Injury <strong>WIP</strong></h3>

<p>A character with a leg injury has difficulty moving quickly. You cannot replace your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#actions">action</a> with a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a> on your turn. You suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boons-banes</a> on any <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">rolls</a> that require you to move more than one space. A group <a class = "keyword" href="travel.html">travel/travel</a> with a character who has a leg injury travels 5 miles / 8km fewer unless the character can be carried.</p>
