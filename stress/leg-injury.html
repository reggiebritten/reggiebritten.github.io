<h3 id="leg-injury-wip">Leg Injury #WIP</h3>

<p>A character with a leg injury has difficulty moving quickly. You cannot replace your <a href="...html#skills\action">action</a> with a <a href="...html#skills\maneuvers">maneuver</a> on your turn. You suffer a <a href="...html#rolls\boons--banes">boons-banes</a> on any <a href="...html#rolls">rolls</a> that require you to move more than one space. A group <a href="...html#overland-travel">travel/travel</a> with a character who has a leg injury travels 5 miles / 8km fewer unless the character can be carried.</p>
