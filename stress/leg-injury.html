<p>A character with a leg injury has difficulty moving quickly. You cannot replace your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#actions">action</a> with a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a> on your turn. You suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">bane</a> on any <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> that requires you to move more than one pace. A group <a class = "keyword" href="travel.html">traveling</a> with a character who has a leg injury travels 5 miles / 8km fewer unless the character can be carried.</p>
