<blockquote>
  <p>Ezekiel the paladin uses his lay on hands ability to save the life of an innocent peasant by transferring 22 stress to himself. As a result, he immediately suffers two afflictions. In this case, the GM decides that he is exhausted by the ordeal and furious at the injustice of things, in that order. After a good night’s rest Ezekiel recovers 3 three stress, and his total falls down to 9. His exhaustion goes into remission and he no longer suffers it’s penalties, although he is still furious.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Later that day during his adventures, Ezekiel suffers four more stress, brining his total to 23. He exhaustion returns, and he once again suffers it’s penalties. After completing the day’s work, Ezekiel decides to return to town for a few days to rest and indulge himself. After the first days, his stress falls to 19 and the exhaustion goes into remission. After several more days, his stress falls to 9; his exhaustion is completely removed and the furious affliction goes into remission. By the end of his rest, his stress is 0 and all his afflictions are gone.</p>
