<h2 id="dying">Dying</h2>

<p>Whenever your total stress rises to 30 or above, you immediately fall <a href="...html#conditions\unconscious">unconscious</a> and begin <strong>dying</strong>. While you’re dying, you suffer an additional 1d4 stress each round, which the GM will usually roll in secret.</p>

<p>When you’re dying, another character can save you with any effect that relives stress, or with a <a href="...html#abilities\cunning">cunning</a> <a href="...html#rolls">roll</a>. The difficulty of the roll starts at easy (d4), but is increased for every two points of stress you have over 30. For example, if you have 34 or 35 stress, the difficulty is standard (d8). Once your stress total rises to 40 or above, you have died, and nothing short of a miracle can bring you back.</p>
