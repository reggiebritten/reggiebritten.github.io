<h2 id="dying">Dying</h2>

<p>Whenever your total stress rises to 30 or above, you immediately fall <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a> and begin <strong>dying</strong>. While you’re dying, you suffer an additional 1d4 stress each round, which the GM will usually roll in secret. When you’re dying, another character can save you with any effect that relives stress, or with a <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a>. The difficulty of the roll starts at easy (d4), but is increased for every two points of stress you have over 30. If you have 32 or 33 stress, the difficulty is simple (d6), 34-35 stress is standard (d8), 36-37 is difficult (d10) and if you have 38 or 39 stress, the difficulty is incredible (d12). <br />
When you’re saved from dying, you no longer suffer additional stress and you regain consciousness. However, if you suffer more stress for any reason, you begin dying again and must be saved once more. Once your stress total rises to 40 or above, you have died, and nothing short of a miracle can bring you back.</p>
