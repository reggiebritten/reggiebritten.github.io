<h2 id="afflictions">Afflictions</h2>

<p>Afflictions are palpable effects that impair you after you have accumulated too much stress. When your total stress rises to 10 or above, you immediately suffer your first affliction. When your stress rises to 20 or above, you suffer your second affliction.</p>

<p>The specific affliction a character receives is related to the source of the stress that caused it. If the stress was caused by a physical <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> or hazard, then you will likely suffer an injury. If the source of the injury is obvious, such as a spiked floor trap causing a foot injury, the GM may assign that injury. If the nature of the injury is not obvious, such as an injury caused by an enemy’s attack, then the GM may determine an injury at random.</p>

<p>If the stress that caused the affliction was from some mental or emotional pain, then the GM may likewise determine which other affliction fits best. If no other affliction makes sense for the source of the stress, then the <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html#exhausted">exhausted</a> affliction may always be applied. You can suffer the same affliction multiple times, in which case the effects stack. The afflictions described here are not a complete list, poisons, diseases, and curses might also manifest as afflictions.</p>

<p>Whenever your total stress falls below one of these thresholds, your oldest affliction goes into remission. While an affliction is in remission, you are in the process of recuperating from it and none of the affliction’s penalties apply. However, if your stress rises to the next multiple of 10 again, the affliction and it’s penalties flare into effect once more. If your stress falls below a multiple of 10 while an affliction is in remission, then that affliction is completely removed and your next-oldest affliction goes into remission as well. When your stress falls to zero, all your afflictions are completely removed.</p>
