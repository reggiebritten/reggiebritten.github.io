<h3 id="hand-injury">Hand Injury</h3>

<p>A character with a hand injury has difficulty holding weapons and manipulating objects. You immediately drop whatever you are holding in one hand (chosen randomly if appropriate). You can only wield one one-handed <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#weapon">weapon</a> and can’t use your injured hand for anything. Two handed weapons are not dropped but can’t be wielded. You suffer <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> on any <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> that requires you to use both hands.</p>
