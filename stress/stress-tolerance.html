<h2 id="stress-tolerance">Stress Tolerance</h2>

<p>You stress tolerance adjusts the thresholds at which you suffer you first and second afflictions, fall unconscious, and die. For example, if your stress tolerance is increased by 3, then you donâ€™t suffer your first affliction until you accumulate 13 stress, your second affliction comes at 23, you fall unconscious and begin dying at 33, and die at 43. You recover from these effects at the same threshold they affected you.</p>
