<h2 id="gaining-abilities">Gaining Abilities</h2>

<p>As characters defeat enemies, overcome obstacles, and complete adventures, they will gain entirely new abilities to use. Forge of Legends doesn’t feature character levels; instead, characters gain abilities by unlocking them with experience.</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<p>Experience is a currency earned by players for overcoming the challenges of the game. The GM will often award two experience points for overcoming a relatively easy encounter, four experience points for besting a moderate encounter, and eight experience points for a truly heroic encounter.</p>

<p>Note that not all encounters require combat; some encounters are designed not to involve combat, while other encounters where combat was expected might still be overcome by some other means. However, encounters that arise from the doom pool often won’t award experience; there’s nothing good about doom.</p>

<p>Completing major goals will often award eight experience and completing minor goals may award two or four experience. In addition, a character gains one experience point the first time they use an unlocked ability in combat against a serious enemy. Character may also gain a few experience points by training, as described in the Downtime Activities chapter below. The GM Guidelines chapter includes more information about awarding experience.</p>

<p>Players may enjoy tracking the total experience their character has earned, but that cumulative total isn’t used for anything. A character’s experience will rise and fall as they overcome challenges and unlock abilities. Unlocking abilities is permanent, but there is no limit to the number of abilities a character may unlock.</p>

<h3 id="ability-tiers">Ability Tiers</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the Classes chapter earlier, character begin with all their class’s basic abilities in their repertoire. Basic abilities are the lowest tier of abilities, but characters can also acquire novice, expert, master, and grandmaster tier abilities.</p>

<p>A character can always unlock novice tier abilities of their class, but expert, master, and grandmaster abilities require the character to have already unlocked twice as many lower tier abilities as the higher tier abilities. To unlock an expert tier ability, the character must already have two novice abilities. To unlock a master tier ability, the character must already have two expert abilities, which in turn requires four novice abilities. And each grandmaster ability requires two master abilities, which requires four expert abilities, and eight novice abilities.</p>

<p>Novice special abilities cost 8 experience points, expert abilities cost 12 experience points, master abilities cost 16 experience points, and grandmaster abilities cost 20 experience points. Passive abilities cost half these amounts. Once a character has earned enough experience, they may unlock a new ability from their buy spending their experience.</p>

<p>Characters can unlock abilities at any time, even during an encounter. As a twist of fate, a player may even spend experience on an ability and declare that they were saving it for just this moment and have it in their fighting style right now, ready to turn the tide of battle!</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="optional-rule-multiclass">Optional Rule: Multiclass</h3>

  <p>Once a character has achieved the pinnacle of their    class, they may wish to explore other classes. If your group uses this    rule, then characters who have unlock a class’s grandmaster ability    may unlock one new class of their choice.    Characters may only have one class at a time, but    characters may swap between their unlocked classes (including their    original class) whenever they adjust their fighting style.    When a character swaps classes, they lose access to the core    feature of their other class and they can’t equip basic, expert,    master, and grandmaster abilities that don’t fit their new    class or archetype. However, they can still use the old class’s novice and    exploration abilities. In exchange, they gain access to the core    feature of their chosen class, as well as all basic and unlocked    abilities of that class or archetype.    When a multiclass character uses experience to unlocks    abilities, they may unlock abilities from any class or archetype they have    unlocked. However, abilities of one class or archetype don’t count toward    unlocking a higher tier ability from an unrelated class or archetype. For    example, two novice warrior abilities don’t allow a character to learn an    expert wizard ability.    When the character finally unlocks a grandmaster ability    from their second class, they may unlock a third class, and the cycle may    continue indefinitely.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="class--archetype">Class &amp; Archetype</h3>

<p>​     In addition to tier, most unlockable abilities have a class or archetype with which they are associated. A character can only unlock abilities that match their class or archetype. For example, the berserker class and weaponmaster class are both archetypes of warrior. They could both unlock abilities with the warrior tag, but only berserkers can unlock berserker abilities and only weaponmasters can unlock weaponmaster abilities.</p>

<p>The exception is the classless tag. A classless ability may be unlocked by any character. Classless abilities still have tiers and are treated like any other ability when determining if a character has enough lower tier abilities to unlock a higher tier ability.</p>

<p>For a complete list of abilities that can be unlocked, see the Unlockable Abilities chapter below.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-style--repertore">Fighting Style &amp; Repertore</h2>

<p>Forge of legends contains countless abilities, and there is no limit to the number of abilities a character might acquire. However, keeping track of all those possibilities in the heat and desperation of combat is too much for anyone to consider.</p>

<h3 id="repitiore">Repitiore</h3>

<p>A character’s repertoire is a list of every ability which they could access. This includes every weapon the character is carrying, all basic abilities from the character class, any unlocked abilities that character has earned (as described below) and any abilities granted by the character’s equipment, including legendary items.</p>

<p>Players may track and organize their repertoire however they like, but it will always be quite a long list and only grow longer. Fortunately, players don’t need to consider every possible ability in the heat of combat, since characters only have access to the abilities in their fighting style.</p>

<h3 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h3>

<p>A character’s fighting style is a list of the weapons and abilities a character is prepared to use at a moment’s notice if a fight breaks out. Unlike a character’s repertoire, their fighting style doesn’t grow as the learn new abilities or acquire more equipment. Instead, those only grant additional options to use in their fighting style.</p>

<p>More specifically, a character’s fighting style always include their class’s core feature and any abilities granted by that. A character can also equip up to four special abilities and four passive abilities, granted by their class or equipment. Finally, each character’s fighting style includes all abilities granted by the weapons and equipment the character has equipped. There are a few ways to gain extra abilities which don’t count against these normal limits.</p>

<p>A character can swap abilities in their fighting style for others in their repertoire by adjusting their equipment, mental battleplan, and locations of their weapons. The whole process only takes one minute, but it would be quite conspicuous to any observers. Once a character has completed the minute of preparations, their new fighting style is ready to use. If the character is interrupted during their preparations, none of their abilities are swapped and they must start again from scratch.</p>

<h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>

<p>A character’s most important tools in combat are their weapons. A character can equip up to four “hands” of weapons in their fighting style. A one-handed weapon counts as one “hand” and a two-handed weapon counts as two “hands.” So, a character could equip four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and one two-handed weapon, or two two-handed weapons.</p>

<p>A character can carry more weapons in their inventory, but they are best stowed away and require at least a minute to retrieve and make ready. Whenever a character adjusts their fighting style, they may use that time to change which weapons are equipped and which are stowed away. Trying to carry more weapons (or similarly large, bulky objects) within easy access imposes the encumbered condition on a character.</p>

<p>Of course, a character can only wield two “hands” of weapons at a time. A character only gains access to a weapon’s abilities while they are wielding it, not merely by having it equipped. During combat, characters can use a maneuver to swap between their weapons, allowing them to wield any other combinations of weapons they have in their fighting style.</p>

<p>​      Most weapons come with two abilities per “hand,” so most one-handed weapons will have two abilities and most two-handed weapons will have four abilities, although there are exceptions.</p>

<p>When wielding two one-handed weapons, it doesn’t matter which hand (right or left) holds which weapon. Wielding two one handed weapons also doesn’t give a character additional attacks, just additional options for how they will use their action or maneuver on their turn.</p>

<p>Not everything called a weapon here is a weapon in the traditional sense; shields, magic wands, and even some music instruments are also considered weapons. For a list of weapons and their abilities, see the Weapon List chapter below.</p>

<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>

<p>Finally, a character’s equipment can contribute abilities to their fighting style as well. Most equipment abilities are very minor passive effects. Some equipment abilities may be more powerful, especially legendary items or consumable items.</p>

<p>Characters gain access to all abilities granted by equipment they are wearing. However, the amount of equipment a character can wear is limited, as described in the Equipment &amp; Inventory chapter below.</p>

<p>Most equipment can also be changed over the course of a minute when a character adjusts their fighting style. However, adjusting some equipment, such as an entire suit of armor, may take longer than a minute, at the GM’s discretion.</p>
