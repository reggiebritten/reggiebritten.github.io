<h2 id="agility">Agility</h2>

<p>Agility represents your characterâ€™s physical coordination and precise control of their body movements. Agile characters can gracefully elude enemies, and balance, squeeze, or tumble their way into areas others would struggle to reach. In combat, agile characters excel quickly finishing off worn-down foes and dashing to the right place at the right time.</p>
