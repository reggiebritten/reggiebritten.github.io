<h2 id="cunning">Cunning</h2>

<p>Cunning represents your character’s awareness, acuity, and insight. Cunning characters can get the drop on hidden enemies or traps, and spot key details that others might miss. Cunning character’s aren’t necessarily more intelligent, just better at noticing details and recognizing opportunities. In combat, cunning characters excel at exploiting a foe’s weakness and creating opportunities for their allies to deliver devastating attacks.</p>
