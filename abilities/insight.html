<p>Canny, Clever, Astute?
Insight represents a character’s awareness, acuity, and cunning. Insightful characters can get the drop on hidden enemies or traps before they can strike, and spot key details that others might miss. Insightful character’s aren’t necessarily more intelligent, just better at noticing details and recognizing opportunities. In combat, insightful characters excel at exploiting a foe’s weakness and creating opportunities for their allies to deliver devastating attacks.</p>
