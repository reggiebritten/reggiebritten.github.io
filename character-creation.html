<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<p>There are a few things you will need to decide when making your character. You should start with an idea for your character’s <strong>concept</strong>, a 3 to 5 word description of their identity. Once you have a concept in mind, write it at the top of your character sheet and let it guide the rest of your decisions when making your character. Some example concepts include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Noble Knight Fighting for Justice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Streetwise Scoundrel Seeking Comfort</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brilliant Magus Amassing Power</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fallen Disciple Seeking Redemption</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lone Wolf Protecting the Pack</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Next, you will need an <a class = "keyword" href="ancestry.html">ancestry</a>. Your ancestry determines your inborn characteristics, but not your upbringing. You will also decide your <a class = "keyword" href="class.html">class</a>. This is your most important decision, as you class determines what kinds of <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skills</a> you will have access to. Your class also tells you what kind of <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html">equipment</a> you start the game with. You will also determine your character’s <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html">abilities</a>; your natural strengths and talents. Spend <strong>8</strong> ability points on either <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>, assigning at least 1 point to each and no more than 5 points to any one ability.</p>

<p>Next, you will decide several features of your character’s <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html">personality</a>. Describe your approach to overcoming obstacles by assigning <strong>6</strong> points to either your <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#bold-vs-subtle">bold</a> value or your <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#bold-vs-subtle">subtle</a> value, both at least 1 and at most 5. Repeat this with another <strong>6</strong> points for your <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#idealistic-vs-pragmatic">idealistic</a> vs <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#idealistic-vs-pragmatic">pragmatic</a> values, describing you views on opportunism, and again with another <strong>6</strong> points for your <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#serious-vs-whimsical">serious</a> vs <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#serious-vs-whimsical">whimsical</a> values, describing your tendency to stay focused or explore possibilities. Finally, determine your character’s <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#training">training</a> by choosing <strong>7</strong> of the listed types of training that represent your character’s upbringing, and past experience.</p>

<p>Many other aspect of your character, such as your in depth expertise, your indulgences and flaws, and especially your personal legend, will all be discovered during gameplay and shouldn’t be decided when you make your character.</p>
