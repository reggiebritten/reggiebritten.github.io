<h3 id="tangled-terrain">Tangled Terrain</h3>

<p>Tangled terrain is covered in thick bushes, webs, or other fibers. While youâ€™re in tangled terrain, all your <a href="...html#skills\attack">attacks</a> suffer a <a href="...html#skills\bane">bane</a>, and all attacks suffer a bane against you. A character <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a> into tangled terrain becomes <a href="...html#conditions\restrained">restrained</a> by the thick fibers. 
A space of tangled terrain is transformed into <a href="burning-terrain.md">burning terrain</a> if it is included in a <a href="...html#skills\fire">fire</a> skill or if it contains a <a href="...html#conditions\burning">burning</a> character. Tangled terrain lasts indefinitely.</p>
