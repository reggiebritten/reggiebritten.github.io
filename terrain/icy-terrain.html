<h3 id="icy-terrain">Icy Terrain</h3>

<p>Icy terrain is covered in a sheet of slippery ice. When you enter icy terrain for the first time in a round or end your turn there, you must spend -4 poise or you become <a href="...html#conditions\unbalanced">unbalanced</a>. For each space you are <a href="...html#combat\shove">shoved</a> into icy terrain, you are moved two spaced instead of one. A character <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a> in icy terrain becomes <a href="...html#conditions\chilled">chilled</a>.
A space of icy terrain included in a fire skill is transformed into <a href="wet-terrain.md">wet terrain</a>. Icy terrain thaws after at least a minute, but could last indefinitely depending on the weather.</p>
