<h3 id="wet-terrain">Wet Terrain</h3>

<p>Wet terrain is covered in at least a foot of water, and deep water is also wet terrain. A <a href="...html#skills\lightning">lightning</a> <a href="...html#skills\blast">blast</a> or <a href="...html#skills\line">line</a> skill that includes a space of wet terrain also includes all adjacent spaces of wet terrain. A character <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a> into wet terrain gains the <a href="...html#conditions\wet">wet</a> condition. While you are in wet terrain, you may choose to become wet as a reaction on your turn.
A space of wet terrain included in a fire or lightning skill is transformed into an <a href="obscuring-cloud.md">obscuring cloud</a>. A space of wet terrain included in an <a href="...html#skills\ice">ice</a> skill is transformed into icy terrain. Wet terrain returns to normal at the end of the round if the water can flow away, otherwise it lasts indefinitely.</p>
