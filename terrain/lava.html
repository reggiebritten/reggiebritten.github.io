<p>Lava is extremely dangerous molten rock. When you enter lava for the first time in a round or end your turn there, you immediately become <a href="...html#conditions\burning">burning</a> and suffer five <a href="...html#stress">stress</a>. A character <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a> into lava suffers 5d6 stress instead. <a href="...html#combat\minion-defense">Minions</a> without <a href="...html#skills\fire">fire</a> <a href="...html#skills\resistant">resistance</a> or <a href="...html#skills\immune">immunity</a> are immediately <a href="...html#combat\defeated">defeated</a> when knocked into lava.
Lava takes at least 10 minutes to cool to safety, and may last indefinitely.</p>
