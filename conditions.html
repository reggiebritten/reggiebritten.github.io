<h1 id="conditions">Conditions</h1>

<p>Conditions are descriptions of a temporary situation a character finds themselves in. Most are bad, some are good, and others may be a mix of both depending on the circumstances. Many conditions are inflicted during combat, but some arise outside combat as well. Each condition lasts until something happens to end it and applies a specific set of bonuses or penalties to the affected character.</p>

<p>Just like abilities, conditions have tags that describe how they interact with other things. The most important tag a condition might have is the <strong>recoverable</strong> tag, which means that the <strong>recovery</strong> ability may be used to attempt to end the condition.</p>

<p>However, all recoverable conditions come with <strong>recovery</strong> requirements that must be met for the recovery ability to be successful. Some conditions require vigor loss, which may be paid either by the character using the recovery ability, the character affected by the condition, or a combination of both. Other conditions have other requirements that must be met as well.</p>

<p>Some effects may also allow characters to directly <strong>remove</strong> or <strong>replace</strong> conditions while ignoring any recovery requirements.</p>

<h2 id="condition-tags">Condition Tags</h2>

<p>Just like abilities, conditions also have tags that describe how they work and interact with other parts of the game.</p>

<h3 id="recoverable">Recoverable</h3>

<h3 id="temporary">Temporary</h3>

<p>A temporary condition is automatically removed from a character at the end of that character‚Äôs turn.</p>

<h3 id="slowing">Slowing</h3>

<p>A sluggish condition makes the character move half the normal distance whenever they use a movement ability.</p>

<h3 id="immobilizing">Immobilizing</h3>

<p>A character with an immobilizing condition can‚Äôt move or use movement abilities. Unless specified otherwise, the character can still be pushed.</p>

<h3 id="conferred-reistance-vulnerability--immunity">Conferred Reistance, Vulnerability &amp; Immunity</h3>

<p>Some conditions change the way the character is affected by certain abilities</p>

<h3 id="disabled-zoc">Disabled-ZoC</h3>

<p>A condition with the Disabled-ZoC tag means the character suffering from it does not have a <strong>zone of control</strong>, no matter what weapons they wield.</p>

<h3 id="disabled-reactions">Disabled-Reactions</h3>

<p>A condition with the Disabled -Reactions tag prevents the character suffering from it from using any <strong>reaction</strong> abilities.</p>

<h3 id="disabled-swapping">Disabled-Swapping</h3>

<p>A condition with the Disabled-Swapping tag prevents the character suffering from it from using swapping weapons under any circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="replaced-by">Replaced By:</h3>

<p>Many conditions have a removed by clause that specifies something that will end the condition when it happens, or a replaced by clause</p>

<h3 id="no-speed">No-Speed</h3>

<p>Can‚Äôt add speed to abilities, only get base speed</p>

<h2 id="condition-list">Condition List</h2>

<h3 id="staggered">Staggered</h3>

<p>üè∑Ô∏è Recoverable Physical Temporary Slowing</p>

<p>A staggered character is unsteady on their feet.</p>

<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> Lose <strong>-1</strong>                                 poise.</p>

<h3 id="restrained">Restrained</h3>

<p>üè∑Ô∏è Recoverable Physical Immobilizing No-ZoC</p>

<p>A restrained character is held in place by some object such as a net or chain.</p>

<p><strong>Push</strong> abilities are <strong>ineffective</strong> on the character. Attack actions against the character gain a boon, and the character‚Äôs attacks suffer a bane.</p>

<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> Either the restrained character or the character using the recovery ability must succeed on a brawn roll to break the restraints, with a TN determined by the material of their restraints. If the roll fails, the character is still restrained.</p>

<h3 id="grabbed">Grabbed</h3>

<p>üè∑Ô∏è Physical No-ZoC</p>

<p>A grabbed character is being held in place by one or more other characters.</p>

<p>Characters involved in the grab lose their <strong>zones of control</strong> and suffer a <strong>bane</strong> on attack actions against characters who are not part of the grab.</p>

<p>If the grabbing character and the gabbed character are within one size category of each other, then the grabbed character cannot move or use movement abilities. The grabbing character can drag the grabbed character along whenever they move, but they move half the usual distance. If two similar sized characters grab each other, then neither can move.</p>

<p>If the characters are two or more size category apart, then the larger character may move freely and the smaller character is pulled along, regardless of who is grabbing whom.</p>

<p>If three or more characters are involved in the grab, then none of them can move unless they are two or more sizes bigger than every other character.</p>

<p>Whenever any character in the grab would be <strong>pushed</strong>, the grabbing character must choose: either they must lose <strong>-3</strong>   momentum, and all characters are pushed, or the grab ends and only the original target of the effect is pushed.</p>

<p>The grabbing character almost always needs to <strong>concentrate</strong> to maintain the grabbed condition. <strong>Interrupting</strong> the grabbing character is often the best way to free a grabbed character.</p>

<h3 id="kneeling">Kneeling</h3>
