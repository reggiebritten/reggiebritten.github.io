<h2 id="lava">Lava</h2>

<p>Lava is extremely dangerous molten rock. When you enter lava for the first time in a round or end your turn there, you immediately become <a href="conditions.html#burning">burning</a> and suffer five <a href="stress.html">stress</a>. A character <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> into lava suffers 5d6 stress instead. <a href="combat.html#minions-defense">Minions</a> without <a href="skills.html#fire">fire</a> <a href="skills.html#resistant">resistance</a> or <a href="skills.html#immune">immunity</a> are immediately <a href="combat.html#defeated">defeated</a> when knocked into lava.</p>

<p>Lava takes at least 10 minutes to cool to safety, and may last indefinitely.</p>
