<h2 id="snowy-terrain">Snowy Terrain</h2>

<p>Snowy terrain is covered in a thick sheet of fluffy snow. A character knocked-down in snowy terrain becomes <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#chilled">chilled</a>.</p>

<p>An area of snowy terrain included in a fire skill is replaced by an obscuring cloud. Snowy terrain thaws after at least a minute, but could last indefinitely depending on the weather.</p>
