<h2 id="shattered-terrain">Shattered Terrain</h2>

<p>Shattered terrain is covered in large rocks or rubble. A character <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> into shattered terrain is <a href="combat.html#disarmed">disarmed</a>.</p>

<p>If a floor becomes shattered terrain, it may collapse into an area below at the GMâ€™s discretion. Wooden floors will usually collapse, but stone ones will usually not. Shattered terrain lasts indefinitely.</p>
