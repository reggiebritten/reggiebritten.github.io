<h2 id="tangled-terrain">Tangled Terrain</h2>

<p>Tangled terrain is covered in thick bushes, webs, or other fibers. While youâ€™re in tangled terrain, all your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a> suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a>, and all attacks suffer a bane against you. A character <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> into tangled terrain becomes <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#restrained">restrained</a> by the thick fibers.</p>

<p>An area of tangled terrain is transformed into <a class = "keyword" href="special-terrain.html#burning-terrain">burning terrain</a> if it is included in a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#fire">fire</a> skill or if it contains a <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#burning">burning</a> character. Tangled terrain lasts indefinitely.</p>
