<h2 id="icy-terrain">Icy Terrain</h2>

<p>Icy terrain is covered in a sheet of slippery ice. When you enter icy terrain for the first time in a round or end your turn there, you must spend -4 poise or you become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#unbalanced">unbalanced</a>. For each space you are <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#shoving">shoved</a> into icy terrain, you are moved two spaced instead of one. A character <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> in icy terrain becomes <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#chilled">chilled</a>.</p>

<p>A space of icy terrain included in a fire skill is transformed into <a class = "keyword" href="special-terrain.html#wet-terrain">wet terrain</a>. Icy terrain thaws after at least a minute, but could last indefinitely depending on the weather.</p>
