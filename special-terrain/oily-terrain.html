<h2 id="oily-terrain">Oily Terrain</h2>

<p>Oily terrain is covered in a layer of slippery, flammable oil. When you enter oily terrain for the first time in a round or end your turn there, you must spend -4 poise or you become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#unbalanced">unbalanced</a>. For each space you are <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#shoving">shoved</a> into oily terrain, you are moved two spaced instead of one. A character <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> in oily terrain becomes <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#oiled">oiled</a>.</p>

<p>Oily terrain is replaced by burning terrain and becomes burning terrain if it is in the area of a fire area or line ability or if it contains a burning character. If one space of oiled terrain becomes burning, all contiguous spaces also become burning. Otherwise, oiled terrain lasts indefinitely.</p>
