The kneeling condition is <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#persistent">persistent</a> while you’re in goopy terrain. When you get up from being <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> while you’re in goopy terrain, you automatically become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#kneeling">kneeling</a>.</p>
