<h2 id="goopy-terrain">Goopy Terrain</h2>

<p>Goopy terrain is covered in mud, sludge, or some other goo that makes moving and getting up difficult. The kneeling condition is <a href="...html#conditions\persistent">persistent</a> while you’re in goopy terrain. When you get up from being <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a> while you’re in goopy terrain, you automatically become <a href="...html#conditions\kneeling">kneeling</a>.</p>
