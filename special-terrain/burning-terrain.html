<h2 id="burning-terrain">Burning Terrain</h2>

<p>Burning terrain is on fire. When you enter burning terrain for the first time in a round or end your turn there, you must spend -4 poise or you become <a href="conditions.html#burning">burning</a>. A character <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> into burning terrain automatically becomes burning.</p>

<p>A space of burning terrain included in a <a href="skills.html#water">water</a> or <a href="skills.html#ice">ice</a> skill is transformed into an <a href="special-terrain.html#obscuring-cloud">obscuring cloud</a>. Burning terrain returns to normal after 1 round unless it contains flammable material. If there is flammable material, then it lasts indefinitely and may spread to other flammable objects.</p>
