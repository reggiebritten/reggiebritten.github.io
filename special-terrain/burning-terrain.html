<h2 id="burning-terrain">Burning Terrain</h2>

<p>Burning terrain is on fire. When you enter burning terrain for the first time in a round or end your turn there, you must spend -4 poise or you become <a href="...html#conditions\burning">burning</a>. A character <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a> into burning terrain automatically becomes burning.</p>

<p>A space of burning terrain included in a <a href="...html#skills\water">water</a> or <a href="...html#skills\ice">ice</a> skill is transformed into an <a href="obscuring-cloud.md">obscuring cloud</a>. Burning terrain returns to normal after 1 round unless it contains flammable material. If there is flammable material, then it lasts indefinitely and may spread to other flammable objects.</p>
