<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>The most straightforward downtime activity you can perform is honest (or not so honest) work. First, you must find someone willing to pay for your services. The nature of the work they offer will determine the type and difficulty of the <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> you will need to succeed. Then, you will roll to determine how well you perform the work. <br />
If the roll results in a <strong>failure</strong>, you earn no money; your performance was too poor to earn pay. If the roll result is <strong>mixed</strong>, you earn <strong>silver</strong> equal to the roll’s total. If the roll is a <strong>success</strong>, you’ve worked well enough to earn a bonus and you are payed <strong>gold</strong> equal to the roll’s total. Note that more difficult work has a higher potential payout, but is less likely to be successful. The GM is unlikely to impose <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#setbacks">setbacks</a> as a result of mundane work, unless it is particularly risky. Work is often <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stressful</a>, even if you perform is successfully; the GM will determine how much stress you suffer.</p>
