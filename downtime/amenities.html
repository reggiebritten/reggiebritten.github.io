<h2 id="amenities">Amenities</h2>
<p>Amenities are beneficial effects you can find that will aid you during your adventures. Most, but not all, amenities can be acquired from civilized society at a price of gold or platinum. For example, you might visit a gourmet restaurant,  grandiose performance, or a luxurious bathhouse, or holy sanctum to acquire their unique amenities.</p>

<p>One you acquire an amenity, you can expect the benefits to stay with you through your adventures until you suffer an affliction. Once you suffer an affliction, all your amenities are removed. Certain results the GM derives from the doom pool might also take away your amenities. You can only benefit from three amenities at a time; if you acquire a fourth amenity, you must choose one of your acquired amenities to lose.</p>

<p>Amenities can have a wide variety of different effects. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increase Your base <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>.</li>
