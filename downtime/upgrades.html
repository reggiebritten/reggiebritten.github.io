<h2 id="upgrades-wip">Upgrades <strong>WIP</strong></h2>
<p>Through careful craftsmanship or rigorous training, you can alter the way that your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skills</a> perform. With access to appropriate crafting tools and several <strong>gold</strong> worth of materials, you can upgrade one skill granted from one <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#weapon">weapon</a>, or other <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html">equipment</a> that you posses. With appropriate training facilities and 2 <a class = "keyword" href="classes.html#experience">experience</a> points, you can upgrade one of your <a class = "keyword" href="class.html">class</a> skills. Both of these approaches take 3 days to complete; if this process is interrupted, you must start it again. Each skill can only be upgraded once; although you can replace one upgrade with a different one. If a piece of equipment has multiple skills, you can upgrade each of them separately, as long as the GM agrees that it makes sense.</p>

<p>When you complete the upgrade process, you may choose the form your upgrade takes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the skill is <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ranged">ranged</a>, increase the range by +5.</li>
  <li>Shift the skills <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#defense">defense</a> cost by one point, e.g. from -2 to -1 or from +3 to +4.</li>
  <li>If the skill is an <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a>, increase skill’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> by +2.</li>
  <li>If the skill is an <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a>, increase or decrease the <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a> dice by 1 size, e.g. d4 to d6 or vice versa.</li>
  <li>Change one of the skill’s tags to another one that makes sense, e.g. replace a skill’s <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#blunt">blunt</a> tag with <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#piercing">piercing</a> by adding a spike.</li>
  <li>Grant the skill a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> when used at a specific time, e.g. grant a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#fire">fire</a> skill a boon when you’re standing in <a class = "keyword" href="special-terrain.html#burning-terrain">burning terrain</a>.</li>
</ul>
