<h2 id="building-bonds">Building Bonds</h2>
<p>With the right time, determination, and insight, you can get to know a new person, place or thing like the back of your hand. When you want to build a new bond, tell the GM who or what you are interested in learning about. This might be an intriguing NPC, a familiar travelling companion, a fabled beast, a quint town, a bustling city district, an untamed wilderness, a strange tome, or even a mysterious legend. However, you don’t need to tell the GM you want to build a bond beforehand; the GM may determine that your past actions are worthy of a new bond.</p>

<p>Each bond you might build has a requirement you must meet to do so, determined by the GM. Places often take time to understand: perhaps a day for a building, a week for a city district or village, or a year for a vast stretch of wilderness. People are often reluctant to trust strangers with their deepest hopes and dreams, so you will often need to earn a person’s trust to build a bond with them. Learning about a legendary sword might require looking up it’s history in a library, or finding the smith who forged it.</p>

<p>All these requirements will usually involve direct access to information regarding the person, place, or thing you want to learn about. You can’t really get to know someone just from talking to their friends, nor can you learn about a place just by hearing a guide’s description. However, the GM may make an exception if a secondary source is particularly detailed, like a whole book on the subject.</p>

<p>Once the GM determines that you have built a new bond, write it down as a permanent part of your character! You can leverage that bond to gain a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boon</a> to any <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> related to the subject, and contribute +4 to any <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#lore-checks">lore check</a> related to the subject. You will hopefully build many bonds over the course of your adventures; when you finally retire, you can look back at all the growth you’ve seen along the way.</p>
