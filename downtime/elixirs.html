<h2 id="elixirs">Elixirs</h2>

<p>Elixirs are alchemical concoctions that can be used for a wide variety of temporary benefits. Each elixir must be started with a <strong>flask of alkahest</strong>, which can be purchased from most alchemists for the price of a few <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#currency">gold</a>. Once you acquire a <strong>flask of alkahest</strong>, you can begin adding ingredients to it in order to make an elixir.</p>

<p>In the course of your adventures, you will acquire <strong>ingredients</strong>, materials infused with alchemically useful properties. Each ingredient contains one of 10 elemental essences: <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#fire">fire</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#water">water</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#earth">earth</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#air">air</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ice">ice</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#lightning">lightning</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#caustic">caustic</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#mental">mental</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#holy">holy</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#unholy">unholy</a>. If you have access to an ingredient, a source of heat, and a <strong>flask of alkahest</strong>, you can extract the elemental essence of the ingredient into the flask over the course of an hour. Doing so destroys the ingredient, but creates or adds effects to an elixir! Elixirs may be composed of one, two or three ingredients, and the number and type of ingredients determines their effects.</p>

<p>Single and double ingredient elixirs can be used in one of four ways, all of which consume the elixir:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As a maneuver, you may drink the elixir or administer it to a character within one pace. Drinking a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#fire">fire</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#lightning">lightning</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#mental">mental</a> elixir removes the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a> condition from you and grants you +4 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>. Drinking a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#water">water</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#air">air</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#caustic">caustic</a> elixir removes the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a> condition from you and grants you +4 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>. Drinking an <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#earth">earth</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ice">ice</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#holy">holy</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#unholy">unholy</a> elixir removes the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> condition from you and grants you +4 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>. Drinking an elixir with two ingredients grants both effects, resulting in +8 defense in total.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an action, you may coat one of your weapons, or one weapon held by a character within one pace. Doing so grants skills with that weapon the tag(s) of the elixir’s ingredient(s) for one minute. For example, a fire elixir would grant your weapon’s skill the fire tag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an action, you may coat your armor or that of another character within one pace. Doing so grants <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#resistant">resistance</a> to the tag(s) of the elixir’s ingredient(s) for one minute. For example, a fire elixir would grant you resistance to the fire tag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a maneuver, you may throw the elixir at a character as a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#thrown">thrown</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ranged">ranged</a>:10 <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a> with 8 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> per ingredient. If the target yields, no dice are rolled but you automatically affect the target with one <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#cunning-effects">cunning effect</a> of each of the elixir’s tags. For example, a fire elixir would let you either inflict <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#burning">burning</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#blinded">blinded</a> on the target.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Elixirs with three ingredients transform into something else entirely. All combinations of three unique ingredient essences have completely different and distinct effects. Explore the world and experiment with ingredients to discover all 120 elixirs!</p>
