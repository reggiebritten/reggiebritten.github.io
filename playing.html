<h1 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h1>

<p>Once the players have created their characters, they are ready to begin playing! At the basic level, playing forge of legends is quite simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The GM describes the scene and any relevant information.</li>
  <li>The players say what their characters try to do.</li>
  <li>The GM decides which if any rules apply, and tells the player their odds of success.</li>
  <li>The player’s characters may attempt the chosen activity, rolling dice to determine the result if necessary.</li>
  <li>The gamemaster describes the outcomes and consequences of the players’ actions.
Players can cooperate to attempt to do anything they can think of in the game world, but they will often be offered a quest or goal by the GM. These goals will often take players to exotic and dangerous locales, where they must defeat fearsome enemies to save the day. However, players are encouraged to look for unorthodox and creative solutions to problems, that’s the stuff that legends are made of!
There are three ways a player might try to achieve their goal: challenges, skills, and fate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overcoming these challenges will reward players with experience, which can be used to unlock new skills. Players may also acquire new weapons and equipment that give them new ways to solve problems.
If tough enemies try to stop the players, they may engage in combat to determine a victor! During combat, players and enemies controlled by the GM take turns until one side gives up the fight or is defeated.
Being defeated in combat, environmental hazards, and distressing experiences can all increase a character’s stress. If a character’s stress rises too high, they suffer afflictions which will force them to rethink their strategy. Stress can accumulate quickly when heroes risk their live against great odds, and only heals slowly when surrounded by safety and comfort. Characters must manage their stress carefully if they want to avoid afflictions, unconsciousness, and even death.
The ultimate goal of this game is to Forge a Legend! A legendary deed is earned when players defeat legendary foes, succeed at legendary challenges, or otherwise create outstanding and memorable experiences at the table. Each legendary deed will result in a completely unique legendary item that commemorates the deed that earned it.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>The gamemaster will call for a challenge when a character attempts a task where the outcome is in doubt. First the player should describe the task their character will attempt and what they hope to accomplish with it. Next, the GM will determine how easy or difficult the task is, and if any ability or personality trait applies. If the GM decides that the task can’t fail or can’t succeed, it is not a challenge. Finally, the dice will be rolled to determine the outcome.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-difficulty">Challenge Difficulty</h3>

<p>The GM will assign each challenge a a dice size based on the task’s difficulty. The dice size should be determined by considering how easy the task would be for a normal person under normal circumstances, including any tools or strategy they are using. The dice size should not take into account a character’s expertise or unusual circumstances; those are represented as bonuses or penalties to the roll, as described below.
| Roll Difficulty                                    |                                                                     |
| ———————— | —- | ———————————————————— | ———————– |
| Difficulty               | Dice Size | Description                                                  | Example Task            |
| Trivial                  | NA        | Everyone can do it; no  roll is needed                       | Walking                 |
| Easy                     | d4        | Most people can do it most of  the time                      | Climbing a tree  |
| Simple                   | d6        | A mild challenge for most  people                        | Lifting a table        |
| Standard                 | d8        | A moderate challenge for most  people                        | Spotting a snake        |
| Difficult                | d10       | A demanding task,  even for an expert                      | Stalking a deer         |
| Incredible               | d12       | Even an expert is likely to fail                    | Catching an arrow       |
| Legendary                | d20       | Even attempting it  sounds ludicrous and succeeding may well be a legendary deed | Riding a dragon         |
| Impossible               | NA        | Some things simply cannot be  done…                          | Leaping to the moon     |</p>

<h3 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</h3>

<p>To determine the outcome of a challenge, roll two dice of the size set by the GM. Compare the result of each die to the character’s score in the ability of the challenge.
If two of the dice are equal to or higher than the TN, the challenge is a success! The player has accomplished their goal. However, if none of the dice exceed the TN, then the challenge is <a href="doomed">doomed</a>! Not only has the attempt failed, it has had additional negative consequences. If exactly one of the dice beats the TN, a mixed success has been rolled. The player must then choose: do they succeed at the task but the challenge becomes  <a href="doomed">doomed</a>? Or do their fail at the task at hand but the challenge becomes <a href="fated">fated</a>?
When a challenge is fated, the player may invoke a twist of fate without spending a fate point. However, the detail added to the world must be somehow related to the nature of the challenge, as determined by the GM. The <a href="GM%20Guidelines">GM Guidelines</a> section has more details on doomed and fated challenges.
A friendly or neutral NPC’s challenges work just like a player’s. However, challenges work slightly differently for hostile or antagonistic NPCs. Whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge would generate a doomed result, then one of the players may invoke a free twist of fate as if they rolled a fated challenge. Conversely, whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge is fated, that generates a doomed effect for the players. The GM will typically choose the player most closely related to the roll to benefit or suffer from NPCs’ fate dice.</p>

<p>&gt;Optional Rule: All or Nothing
&gt;Your group might wish to offer a player the way to raise the stakes of a challenge. At any time you may add a boon to a challenge. However, if less than three dice exceed the TN, then it is automatically doomed as if 0 dice did.</p>

<h3 id="boons--banes">Boons &amp; Banes</h3>

<p>If the character has any background details that would make them significantly more component at this task in specific than they normally are at this type of task, each of those details adds a boon to the challenge. Likewise if there are any unusual circumstances that benefit the character, then each of those adds a boon as well.
For each boon that a character has on a challenge, roll one additional ten-sided die and compare it to the TN. It counts just like the other dice for determining the success of the roll. Furthermore, if three or more dice beat the TN, then the challenge is fated!  Not only has it succeeded, the roll provides additional benefit to the character.
&gt;Which background details are specific enough grant a boon?
&gt;A background detail that could apply to many different challenges is not specific enough to grant a boon. For example, a player might point out that their character is used to sneaking around from their time in the slums, so they should get a boon to sneaking through the forest. However the GM would decide that such a background detail is not specific enough to be relevant to this challenge. On the other hand, if they were sneaking through a city, such a background detail would certainly help.</p>

<p>If the character has any background details that would significantly interfere with their completion of the task, then each of these adds a bane to the challenge. However, the player is awarded a fate point when their background impose a significant hinderance. Having a rich and exciting background tends to pay off in the long term, even when it causes short term complications. Each unusual circumstance that would hider the character also add a bane.
Each bane that a character has cancels out one of their boons for the challenge. If there are any excess banes, each one of those forces the character to roll another ten-sided die. Then, only the lowest two of all the dice are considered for determining the outcome of the roll.
&gt;Sometimes, it is only a matter of time before a character accomplishes their goal, such as thoroughly searching an entire room. In that case, the challenges may represent how long it takes to succeed rather than deciding success or failure. The GM may decide how long an action takes, but the higher the roll, the faster it goes. Spending too much time can come with its own risks, outlined in the <a href="exploration/exploration.md">Exploration</a> section below.</p>

<h3 id="group-challenges">Group Challenges</h3>

<p>Sometimes, multiple characters can cooperate toward resolving a challenge. If the challenge is one than benefits from having multiple characters, then the GM will set the TN based on the contributing character for whom the challenge would be easiest. This might be the the character with the highest relevant ability score, the character with the best tools for the job, or the character with the best plan of action. Some circumstances may also raise or lower the target number of the roll. For example, one person trying to lift a horse might be incredible, but for four people it might only be difficult. However, if the challenge would be hindered by multiple participants, such as sneaking around as a group, then the GM will set the TN based on the character for whom the challenge would be most difficult. 
Next, each coopering character may contribute their relevant background details, granting a boon (or a bane for hindering details) for each. Unusual circumstances that apply boons or banes should be accounted for as well A circumstance only needs to affect one character, not all characters, in order to add a boon or bane, . Finally, one player rolls the dice to determine the result of the entire group. If the challenge becomes mixed, fated or doomed, all participants should collaborate to decide what happens.</p>

<h1 id="fate--doom">Fate &amp; Doom</h1>

<p>Fate is funny thing. Heroes, especially those who stay true to themselves and to their friends, often find that destiny is on their side. In Forge of Legends, fate is a system for rewarding players for expressing their characters’ personality, and for giving players some control over the game world beyond the actions of their characters.
Players will gain fate through fateful deeds: momentous decisions which are described in the <a href="personality.md">Personality</a> section. Characters also gain fate whenever one of their background details poses a significant obstacle to themselves or the group, as determined by the GM. Some GMs may choose to award fate points to players who make the game more fun for everyone, such as taking an amazing risk or spouting an exceptional joke.
When a player earns a fate point, they should add it to their total number and keep track of them. Each player may save up to 3 fate points at a time. If a player already has 3 fate points when they earn another, they may give their new fate point to another player instead.  Note that fate points belong to an individual player, not merely their character. Players may gain and spend fate points even in situations where their character is not present, if the GM deems it appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="twists-of-fate">Twists of Fate</h2>

<p>Players may spend their fate points by invoking a twist of fate at any time to add detail to the game world. Some common twists of fate would be: adding a feature to the environment, adding an item to their character’s inventory, or embellishing their character’s background, all of which may add bonuses or penalties. Any detail, no matter the subject and no matter how large or small, can be invoked by a twist of fate. However, players may only add detail, not remove or change details that have already been established.
When a player declares that they would like to invoke a twist of fate, they should describe the detail they would like to add to the world. The game master then decides if that detail could reasonably exist, and if it hasn’t already been established. If so, the player may spend their fate point and the detail they suggested is added to the game world. Alternatively, a successful <a href="playing/challenges.md">challenges</a> might allow a player to invoke a twist of fate for free!</p>

<h2 id="doom">Doom</h2>

<p>The doom pool represents long term complications that impose obstacles between them and their goals. Many things can generate doom, such as failing challenges, dawdling in dangerous locales, and the machinations of the villains. The GM Guidelines section dictates how the GM can use doom, but it will always be used to cause problems for the players. Players should try their best to minimize the amount of doom the GM accrues.</p>
