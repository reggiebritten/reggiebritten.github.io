<h2 id="legends-of-old">Legends of Old</h2>

<p>Not all legendary items will be created by the players. Many legends have left their mark on the world already. All legendary items are the symbols for legendary deeds of the past and have effects that reflect those epic histories. 
Legendary items are memorable by their very nature, and it is obvious to anyone if a particular item has a legendary past. However the name and effects of an item are not always obvious. Holding and meditating upon an unknown legendary item for one minute imparts a vague knowledge of the legendary deed that created it. But the effects of a legendary item must usually be deduced by trial and error. Once they have been discovered, the name and full history of the legendary item reveals itself to the person who has mastered it.</p>
