<h2 id="legendary-deeds">Legendary Deeds</h2>

<p>The first step toward forging a legend is achieving a legendary deed. A legendary deed is a feat that will be recounted and admired for countless generations to come. Whenever your group does something extraordinary, the GM may award you with a legendary deed!
There are many ways to accomplish a legendary deed, such as defeating a powerful foe, ingeniously overcoming an obstacle, or performing an amazing feat of skill. There are no limits on what could be considered a legendary deed, but the deed must be truly legendary - a tale worth retelling through the ages!
You are encouraged to nominate the actions of your allies if you feel that their deeds are legendary, but the GM always has the final say. A legendary deed may not always be recognized right away. If your group comes to realize how incredible a past action truly was, the GM may declare the past action to be a legendary deed.</p>
