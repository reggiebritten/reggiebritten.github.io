<p>Major effects are the most important part of legendary items, and the things for which such items will be renowned. Many major effects will take the form of powerful <a href="...html#skills">skills</a>. They may be combat abilities or be valuable for exploration and interaction. They may be passive skills that are always in effect, skills that must be recovered between uses, or powerful skills that can only ever be used once.
The GM should decide on a suitable major effect based on your suggestions. If you aren’t satisfied with the GM’s decision, you may continue the discussion until you come up with something that is agreeable to everyone. Some examples of major effect include:</p>

<ul>
