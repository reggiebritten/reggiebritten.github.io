<h2 id="damaging-objects">Damaging Objects</h2>

<p>The GM will call for a <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">brawn</a> <a href="...html#rolls">roll</a> to damage or destroy an object. Most object are impossible to damage without the right tools; most people can’t chop through a door or cut a rope with their bare hands.</p>

<p>Many effects of a damaged object are obvious; a damaged door no longer blocks passage, a damaged wagon can’t roll, and so on. Equipment can also be damaged in which case it suffers the <a href="...html#conditions\damaged">damaged</a> condition. Damaged equipment can usually be repaired in town. In extreme cases, like a blade snapped entirely in half, the object may be considered <a href="...html#conditions\destroyed">destroyed</a> beyond repair.</p>

<p>A damaged weapon suffers a <a href="...html#skills\bane">bane</a> on all <a href="...html#skills\attack">attacks</a>. Damaged <a href="...html#equipment\armor">armor</a> provides two fewer points of armor, possibly zero. Other damaged equipment can’t be used and doesn’t provide any of its benefits or abilities. <a href="...html#legends">Legendary items</a> are no exception and may become damaged or even destroyed as well. However, even if a legendary symbol is broken, the legend itself will remain and find a new symbol in time.</p>
