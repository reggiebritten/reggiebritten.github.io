<h2 id="damaging-objects">Damaging Objects</h2>

<p>The GM will call for a <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> to damage or destroy an object. Most object are impossible to damage without the right tools; most people can’t chop through a door or cut a rope with their bare hands.</p>

<p>Many effects of a damaged object are obvious; a damaged door no longer blocks passage, a damaged wagon can’t roll, and so on. Equipment can also be damaged in which case it suffers the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#damaged">damaged</a> condition. Damaged equipment can usually be repaired in town. In extreme cases, like a blade snapped entirely in half, the object may be considered <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#destroyed">destroyed</a> beyond repair.</p>

<p>A damaged weapon suffers a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> on all <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a>. Damaged <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#armor">armor</a> provides no armor. Other damaged equipment can’t be used and doesn’t provide any of its benefits or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skills</a>. <a class = "keyword" href="legends.html">Legendary items</a> are no exception and may become damaged or even destroyed as well. However, even if a legendary symbol is broken, the legend itself will likely remain and find a new symbol in time.</p>
