<h2 id="falling">Falling</h2>

<p>When you are shoved off a ledge or fail at jumping or climbing, you begin falling. However, if you are near a ledge, rope, or other grabbable surface when you begin to fall, you may immediately grab that surface and be dangling from it instead. Dangling is still an extremely dangerous position to be in. You’re considered <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, you can’t <a href="...html#combat\defending-vs-yielding">defend</a> against attacks, and you suffer a <a href="...html#rolls\boons--banes">bane</a> on <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">brawn</a> <a href="...html#rolls">rolls</a> to climb back up.</p>

<p>When you fall from a height, you suffer <a href="...html#stress">stress</a> based on how far they fell. You can safely jump down two spaces, or fall accidentally one space, with no consequence. If you fall farther than that the GM will call for an agility roll. Each success lets your treat the fall as if it was two spaces shorter. For each excess space fallen, you suffer 1d6 stress.</p>
