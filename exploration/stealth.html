<h2 id="stealth">Stealth</h2>

<p>When you try to hide from or sneak past enemies, the GM will call for an <a href="rolls.html#opposed-rolls">opposed</a> <a href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a> <a href="rolls.html">roll</a>. The <a href="rolls.html#opposed-rolls">difficulty</a> of the roll is determined by the highest <a href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a> of any enemy you try to avoid. The GM may further adjust the difficulty based on factors such as your distance, the amount of cover you have, and the amount of light in the area. Using two <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> in a turn, using the <a class="item" data-name="Sprint">Sprint</a> skill, or otherwise moving quickly imposes a <a href="rolls.html#boons--banes">bane</a> on the agility roll. Hiding from sight without any cover is usually impossible. The GM might decide that each roll represents one round of movement, but a roll might also use one roll to describe several rounds, minutes, or hours.</p>

<p>A complete failure on this roll will mean your enemies have noticed you. A mixed roll will usually mean that your enemies haven’t noticed you yet, but have noticed that something is amiss. They won’t be <a href="conditions.html#surprised">surprised</a> if you attack and might begin searching for you.</p>

<p>If you successfully hide from an enemy, they do not know where you are and can’t target you with skills. If you spring from hiding to <a href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> an enemy who couldn’t see you, then you gain a <a href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> on the attack. If your enemies weren’t even aware that something was amiss, they become <a href="conditions.html#surprised">surprised</a> as well!</p>

<p>Skills are assumed to make a significant amount of noise, whether it’s the clatter of footfalls, grunts of exertion, the clang of steel on steel, the thrum of a bowstring, or arcane words of power. The exception to this rule is a skill that has the <a href="skills.html#stealthy">stealthy</a> tag, which can be used without making a commotion.</p>
