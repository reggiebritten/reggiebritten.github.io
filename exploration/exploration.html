					<h1 id="environments--exploration">Environments &amp; Exploration</h1>

<p>Many adventures in Forge of legends will take place in wild and exotic landscapes. Players might need to hack their way through a tangled jungle, spelunk to the bottom of a dark cave, or climb to the top of a snowy mountain. All these locales can pose serious challenges to unprepared adventurers. At other times, the heroes will need to jump, climb, swim, or sneak, or smash their way into a particular location.</p>

<h2 id="special-movement">Special Movement</h2>

<p>Most movement rules assume characters are simply walking or running. But when characters try to jump, climb, swim, or even fly, these special rules may apply.</p>

<h3 id="jumping">Jumping</h3>

<p>A character can easily jump a number of spaces horizontally equal to one plus their brawn with a running start, or half that distance if they don’t have a running start. A character can jump vertically a number of feet equal to their brawn, or about 1/3rd that many meters. If a character wants to jump farther or higher, the GM will call for a brawn talent roll to see if they succeed or fail.
A character can jump as part of any movement ability, and spaces moved while jumping count against the total number of spaces they may move. A character who runs out of movement in the middle of their jump may end their turn suspended in the air. On their next turn, the must either use movement to complete the jump or they fall.</p>

<h3 id="climbing">Climbing</h3>

<p>Climbing up an easy structure like a ladder typically doesn’t require a talent roll. Climbing up a rope, tree, or cliff usually requires a brawn roll with a target number set by the GM.
A character can use a movement ability to climb, but they must spend two points of movement for every space they climb. In general, character can’t use actions while climbing, although the GM may make exceptions. A character in the middle of climbing when attacked can’t defend against the attack; they must suffer the attack’s yield (described in the Combat chapter below).</p>

<h3 id="falling">Falling</h3>

<p>When a character is shoved off a ledge or fails at jumping or climbing, they may begin falling. However, if such a character is near a ledge, rope, or other grabbable surface when they begin to fall, they may immediately grab that surface and be dangling from it instead.
Dangling is still an extremely dangerous position to be in. The character suffers a bane on brawn talent rolls to climb back up, and if they fail such a roll, they fall to the ground below. A character dangling from a ledge during combat is considered knocked-down and will fall if shoved again, and can’t defend against attacks as if they were climbing.</p>

<p>When a character falls, they suffer stress based on how far they fell. A character can jump down two spaces, or fall accidentally one space, with no consequence. If they fall farther than that, they may suffer up to 1d6 stress for each additional space fallen, and afflictions based on the stress. The falling character may make an agility talent roll to break their fall; for every three points of the roll, the fall is treated as if it was one space shorter.</p>

<h3 id="swimming">Swimming</h3>

<p>Characters in Forge of Legends are assumed to be competent swimmers, although a character with a background detail that says otherwise may gain a fate point when required to swim. However, swimming through stormy seas or rushing rapids will often require a brawn talent roll.</p>

<p>A character needs to spend two points of movement for every space they move while swimming. A character in a moving body of water may be carried along with the flow if they don’t swim faster. Several rules apply to fighting in or under water, which are detailed in the Combat chapter below.</p>

<h3 id="flying">Flying</h3>

<p>Many mythical creatures possess the power of flight. A flying creature must spend two movement points for ever space it ascends, but it gains an additional movement point for every space descended. A flying creature ignores most special terrain.</p>

<p>A flying creature that becomes keeling immediately falls six spaces as well, and a creature that becomes knocked-down falls 12 spaces. They fall that same distance at the end of each of their turns as long as the conditions persist. Any flying creature without the hover ability must to use a movement ability each turn, or it falls six spaces. However, all flying creatures can partially control their fall. If they hit the ground, they treat the fall as if it were half the distance (halved before the one free space for an accidental fall).</p>

<h3 id="breath-holding">Breath Holding</h3>

<p>A character who unexpectedly finds themselves plunged under water suffers the choking condition, and the choking condition can’t be removed while they remain underwater. A character may also become choking if they are unexpected immersed in a toxic cloud or buried.</p>

<p>However, a character who intentionally holds their breath on their turn is immune to the choking condition. A character holding their breath in combat loses-2                                 momentum, -2   poise at the end of their turn, down to a minimum of one.</p>

<p>A character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to six plus double their brawn. However, any round in which the character uses an action or two maneuvers counts as three rounds of holding their breath instead of one. When a character’s breath runs out, the suffer 1d6 stress each round until they take a breath.</p>

<h2 id="light--darkness">Light &amp; Darkness</h2>

<p>The level of light in an area is described by one of three terms: bright, dim, or dark.</p>

<p>Daylight, torches, and campfires all cast bright light, which imposes no penalties or modifications. An starry night in an open field or the border of a fire may be dim light. All actions used against targets in dim light suffer a bane.</p>

<p>A dark area, such as a the depths of a cave or a midnight forest, is almost completely devoid of light. Most characters can’t see in darkness, meaning they can’t even target other characters with abilities. If a character moves more than one space without being able to see where they are going, they may bump into something, making noise and suffering stress.</p>

<p>All skills are assumed to make a significant amount of noise, whether it’s the clatter of footfalls, grunts of exertion, the clang of steel on steel, the thrum of a bowstring, or arcane words of power. The exception to this rule is a skill that has the <a href="skills/stealthy.md">stealthy</a> tag, which can be used without making a commotion.</p>

<h2 id="hiding--perception">Hiding &amp; Perception</h2>

<p>When a character wants to hide from another character or a group, there are a few factors to consider. First, a character must have something to hide behind or at least dim light to conceal them; a character can’t hide in plain sight.</p>

<p>To become hiding, a character can use the hide ability, which lets them move a short distance and attempt an agility talent roll. While already hiding, a character can normally move three spaces plus their speed, where each space is about five feet or 1½ meters.</p>

<p>The GM will usually call for an agility roll each time the hiding character moves. However, the GM may also call for only one roll for a large amount of movement, or a roll to remain concealed even when not moving, if appropriate.</p>

<p>Weather the agility roll to become hidden passes or fails depends on the perception of the characters they’re trying to hide from. A character’s perception describes their awareness and how difficult they are to sneak up on, and is normally equal to six plus their cunning.</p>

<p>When determining if a character successfully hides from other characters, their agility roll must be higher than the perception of every character that they’re trying to hide from. Hiding from some but not all characters means those who do notice something suspicious will almost always warn their allies.</p>

<p>If the hiding character’s agility roll is successful, they gain the hidden condition and their movements were unnoticed. If your enemies haven’t seen you yet and aren’t engaged in combat, then they are also surprised if you spring from hiding ready to strike! If the roll to hide fails against an alert enemy, then the character was probably noticed.</p>

<h3 id="other-circumstances">Other Circumstances</h3>

<p>A character’s perception number assumes the character is vigilant and alert for danger nearby. However, when a character is in friendly territory and not expecting an attack, they will probably be relaxed. A relaxed character’s perception is two points lower than normal. Some conditions can also reduce perception, like unconscious (-6) blinded (-4), deafened (-2), distracted (-2), and drunk (-2).</p>

<p>The first time a character fails an agility roll to hide from or sneak past a relaxed character, that character will become alert. If an NPC has allies nearby, they will probably warn those allies, making them all alert. An alert NPC might move to investigate the area, prepare their defenses, or even start running away. A recently alerted NPC won’t typically be surprised if attacked. When an agility roll to hide fails against an alert character, the hiding character is immediately spotted.</p>

<p>A character sneaking in dim light adds a boon to their agility roll to remain hidden. A character behind cover, in overgrown terrain, in an obscuring cloud, or who is otherwise difficult to spot also gains a boon. A character can only gain one boon from any of these circumstances, even if multiple apply.</p>

<p>A character moving completely out of sight of any possible enemies gains two boons in the roll instead. This includes a character moving through complete darkness, if none of the enemies can see in darkness. However, unless the sneaking character can see in darkness, they also add a bane to their roll, cancelling out the boon.</p>

<p>Using two maneuvers in a turn, using the sprint ability, or otherwise moving quickly imposes a bane on the agility roll. Using an action or an audible ability almost always reveals the hidden character.</p>

<h2 id="pursuit">Pursuit</h2>

<p>When faced with an overwhelming enemy, there is often no choice left but to flee. These rules for pursuit should be used when ever one character or group attempts to escape the pursuit of another.</p>

<p>The GM will start by identifying which character or group is the <strong>pursued</strong>, attempting to escape, and who is the <strong>pursuer</strong>, attempting to catch them. If both sides intend to apprehend each other, the rules for combat should probably be used instead. Next, the GM will determine the <strong>gap</strong> between the pursued and the pursuer(s). This gap is the number of spaces between the two along the most obvious path. For example, if characters are 30 feet across a narrow ravine with a bridge 20 feet away, the GM would typically set the gap at 14 spaces; 4 to get to the bridge, 6 to cross it, and another 4 to get to the pursued’s starting location (jumping across would be a <strong>shortcut</strong>, detailed below).</p>

<p>The details of the <strong>pursued,</strong> <strong>pursuer</strong>, and <strong>gap</strong> may depend on the circumstances. For example, if the heroes want to catch just one member of an enemy group to question them, then the GM would likely set the gap as the number of spaces to the nearest enemy. On the other hand, if the heroes want to make sure none of the enemy group escape to warn their accomplices, then GM would likely set the gap as the distance to the furthest enemy. Multiple character starting from different locations may have their own gaps to their pursued targets. The GM may always increase or decrease the gap(s) as such circumstances change.</p>

<p>Once the gap between the pursuer and the pursued is established, the first round of the pursuit begins! Each character makes an <strong>agility</strong> roll; the pursuer subtracts their roll from the gap, while the pursued adds their roll to the gap. Unlike combat, all pursuit rolls and actions are made at the same time.If the remaining gap is zero or less, the pursuer has caught the pursued and may knock them to the ground! If there is a gap remaining at the end of the round, the chase goes on and another round begins.</p>

<p>A character may continue the pursuit for a number of rounds equal to their <strong>brawn</strong>. After that number of rounds, that character runs out of stamina and can no longer keep up. If all of the pursuers run out of stamina, the pursued inevitably escapes; if the pursued runs out of stamina, they are inevitably caught.</p>

<p>On each round of the pursuit, each character may also roll the fate die. If they roll above their fated action threshold, they may invoke a discounted twist of fate as normal.</p>

<p>Quarry gets away if the set an obstacle that the pursuers can’t overcome.</p>

<p>Hiding costs 4/3 gap</p>

<p>obstacle encounter</p>

<p>shortcuts</p>

<p>shortcut is revealed</p>

<p>doom is spent</p>

<p>The pursuers goal is, of course, to catch the pursued. THe pursueds goal, on the other hand, is to <strong>escape</strong>.</p>

<p>Getting to a location the pursuers can’t acess, such as rowing away in the lost boat or crossing a rope bridge then cutting it.</p>

<p>Hiding and slipping away unnoticed, such as a slipping unnoticed into the sewer system or mingling with an unsuspecting crowd.</p>

<p>Finding backup or encountering something else that would cause the pursuers to rethink their pursuit.</p>

<p>A character’s skills may also play a role in a pursuit. It is assumed that all characters involved in a chase are using the dash maneuver twice a turn to run as fast as possible, and the bonus speed granted by their agility is represented by the bonus to their agility roll made during the chase. Using other skills risks falling behind in the chase; if a character uses an action or maneuver other than dash, the gap shifts three [placeholder] spaces against them and they can’t add their agility to their pursuit roll that turn. However, the GM may adjust the gap if the skill lets them move or resolve other effects of the skill as appropriate.</p>

<p>These chase rules can also be used when two or more character are all racing to reach a goal before the others.</p>

<p>The pursued might also be an object or a location, such as a runaway wagon or a magical artifact.</p>

<h2 id="time--doom">Time &amp; Doom</h2>

<p>Time is not on the side of the heroes. The longer they take to complete an adventure, the more their enemies will be prepared and the greater the chance for disaster.</p>

<p>The GM may describe each location the players visit as safe, wild, dangerous, or deadly. A safe location, such as a respectable city, a well-traveled road, or a peaceful grassland, does not accumulate doom. However, exploring a wild location such as a spooky forest or craggy hills risks attracting unwanted attention. The GM will increase the doom pool by one for each day spent in a wild location.</p>

<p>A dangerous location might be a cursed swamp, a haunted graveyard, or a forgotten ruin. The doom pool will increase by one for every hour of time spend in a dangerous location. Finally, a deadly location, such as an enemy encampment or an evil wizard’s tower, will increase the doom pool for every 10 minutes passed. Heroes should spend no longer than necessary in such locations and return to safety whenever possible.</p>

<p>When time is critical, such as right before a villain’s plans comes to completion, the GM may increase the doom pool even faster, such as every minute or even every round. Other factors can increase doom as well, such as letting an enemy escape to warn its allies or making a loud commotion that might attract attention. Guidelines for using the doom pool can be found in the GM Guidelines chapter below.</p>

<h2 id="overland-travel">Overland Travel</h2>

<p>The heroes’ adventures will often take them to far off and exotic locations. To get there will likely take days or even weeks of travel. How long it takes and how much stress the travelers suffer depends mostly on the terrain and the weather, but mounts, vehicles and ships may make the journey easier or faster.
In general, travel time is measured in days, where a typical day’s travel consists of about 10 hours walking, 4 hours resting, cooking and camping, and 10 hours sleeping and keeping lookout. However, the GM may present certain challenges, like crossing a dangerous river or descending a steep canyon, as individual encounters separate from the normal day’s travel.
Stress accumulated from terrain or weather is applied to all characters in the group at the end of the day’s travel. If terrain or weather reduces the distance traveled to zero, then no progress is made that day but stress will still accrue. The stress of travel only applies to character actually traveling overland, not characters resting in place. Characters accumulating too much stress may need to stop and rest for a day or two before continuing. Character may also use travel activities and some downtime activities, detailed below, while resting for a day.
Whether traveling or resting for a day in the wilderness, characters will likely come across one or more encounters. Some of these encounters may be benign, a few may even be beneficial, but many will pose challenges the players must overcome. The larger the doom pool, the worse each encounter is likely to be, as described in the GM Guidelines chapter.
Traveling through a wild location is likely to increase the doom pool, so characters may prefer to avoid such places if they have the luxury of time. However, when time is scarce, taking the long way around may accrue even more doom.
The GM may rule that some abilities can’t be used in certain types of terrain and weather. Water abilities may fail in parched deserts and fire abilities may fizzle in a torrential downpour.</p>

<h3 id="terrain">Terrain</h3>

<p>Terrain is the type of landscape the characters are traveling through, and it has the biggest impact on how far they can travel and how difficult the journey is.
A list of terrain types, normal travel distance, and stress per day are show in the table below. Woods, shrubland, hills and roads all modify the distance and/or stress of the journey, in addition to whatever terrain type they are a part of. A road can never reduce the stress form traveling below zero.
| Travel  Time &amp; Stress by Terrain &amp; Weather |                              |                |
| —————————————— | —————————- | ————– |
| Terrain / Weather Type                     | Travel Distance (miles / km) | Stress per Day |
| Plains                                     | 20 / 32                      | 0              |
| Tundra                                     | 15 / 24                      | 1              |
| Desert                                     | 20 / 32                      | 2              |

| Jungle                                     | 5 / 8                        | 3              |
| Snow &amp; Ice                                 | 5 / 8                        | 3              |
| Woods or Shrubland                         | -5 / -8                      | 0              |
| Hills                                      | -5 / -8                      | +1             |
| Road                                       | +5 / +8                      | -1 (minimum 0) |
| Clear Weather                              | 0                            | 0              |
| Foul Weather                               | -5 / -8                      | +1             |
| Mild Storm                                 | -10 / -16                    | +5             |
| Severe Storm                               | -25 / -40                    | +1 per hour    |</p>

<h3 id="weather">Weather</h3>

<p>The weather while traveling can have just as much effect as the terrain. The weather is described in one of four terms: clear weather, foul weather, mild storm, and severe storm.</p>

<p>Clear weather is a sunny or cloudy day with no precipitation, it has no effect on travel speed or stress. Foul weather might be light rain or snow, a heat wave, or a cold snap. Foul weather decreases travel distance for the day by five miles and increases the stress for traveling by one.</p>

<p>A mild storm might describe a rainstorm, or a light blizzard or dust storm. Traveling during a mild storm is not recommended, the travel distance is reduced by 10 and characters suffer five stress if they choose to travel that day. Characters who aren’t traveling may even suffer three stress if they can’t manage to find shelter from the storm.</p>

<p>A severe storm is a thunderstorm, hurricane, or an extreme blizzard or dust storm. Travel is impossible, and any character exposed to the elements suffers one stress per hour. Some weather, like tornadoes and supernatural storms, may have even more immediate and dangerous consequences.</p>

<p>Some pieces of equipment like warm or cool clothing can help protect against the weather.</p>

<h3 id="forced-march">Forced March</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when speed is of the essence, characters can push themselves to travel further than normal. Characters can choose to travel up to double the normal travel distance, however they suffer one stress for each 1/5th of the day’s normal travel distance.</p>

<p>For example, characters may choose to travel up to 30 miles through hilly plains, but they suffer one stress for each three miles traveled beyond the first 15.</p>

<h3 id="mounts">Mounts</h3>

<p>Mounts, such as horses, make travel easier and more convenient over long distances. A horse or donkey can carry much more bulk than a person.</p>

<p>With proper pack saddles, a donkey can carry 50 bulk, a horse, mule, or camel can carry about 100 bulk,  and an ox can carry 150 bulk, not including a rider. A horse, mule, camel, or ox needs to eat five supplies per day, and a donkey eats one. However, these animals can usually forage for food where grass is plentiful.</p>

<p>Mounts are also more comfortable, a character traveling mounted suffers one less stress per day from traveling through any terrain. However, mounted travel doesn’t protect against the effects of weather. Mounts themselves may become stressed and suffer afflictions if taken to extreme environments or not cared for.</p>

<p>While many mounts are capable sprinters, they aren’t much faster over the course of a day. Even with mounts, a group’s overland speed is limited by terrain according to the above table. If time is of the essence, a mount may cover the entire day’s travel in half the time, but that would be very stressful for the mount and it couldn’t go any further that day.</p>

<h3 id="vehicles--ships">Vehicles &amp; Ships</h3>

<p>Wagons, Carriages, and Ships can all make travel more comfortable. A wagon or carriage reduces the stress of both terrain and weather by one per day. They also double the amount that the pack animal pulling them can carry. However, wagons and carriages travel 5 miles    (8 km) per day more slowly even on roads, and 10 miles (16 km) more slowly where there isn’t a road.</p>

<p>Large sailing ships can travel around 100 miles per day, depending on their size and construction. Prevailing winds may increase or decrease this speed depending on their direction. Travel aboard a large ship is not very stressful, even stormy weather may only cause one stress per day. However, a terrible storm may damage the ship itself. A rowboat travels only five miles per day in still water and doesn’t protect against the weather.</p>

<h2 id="travel-activities">Travel Activities</h2>

<p>While traveling, heroes can undertake additional activities that help them on their adventure. The three travel activities are scouting, entertaining, and foraging. When beginning travel each day, each character should pick one travel activity to do during the day. Multiple scouts, entertainers, or foragers follow the rules for group rolls described above.</p>

<p>Trailblazing
Hauling
Scouting
Hunting
Gathering
Nagivating
Provisioning - prevent supply loss by crating, etc
Relaxing
Utility - set your own specific priotiry, such as keeping an item safe or decypering directions, managing enviromental hazards like quicksand. Gain a boon on all relevant checks. make a map</p>

<p>Guard? Scare off wild animals / bandits? first into action when dangert arises?</p>

<p>Who remains alert for being followed? Who covers tracks.
Who finds ruins, campsites, monster signs, etc?</p>

<p>Forecast = predict weather</p>

<p>character roles will dictate where they are if a giht breaks out - trailblazers and scounts will generally lead the way, with navigators close behind. Hunters and foragers will ghenerally be to the side and a little off the beaten path looking for resouirces. Hauler’s provisioners, and relaxers will generally be in the back taking care of or partaking in supplies.</p>

<p>While the navigator helps their group stay on tack (often literally) toward thier goal, a scout looks out for potential dangers.</p>

<p>A scouting character stays a bit away from the main group to keep a lookout for hazards, enemies, tracks, or to make sure the group doesn’t get lost. If any of those challenges present themselves during the day’s travel, the GM will call for the scouting character to make a cunning talent roll, with a target number determined by the nature of the problem.</p>

<p>If the scouting character succeeds, they recognize the challenge before it becomes a problem. They will spot a hazards or enemies from a distance a distance, correctly follow tracks, and keep the group on track.</p>

<p>However, if the scouting character fails the roll, they don’t notice the problem until it is too late. They may not notice hazard or enemies until the group stumbles into them, they may lose whatever tracks they were following for the day, or the group may become lost. If the scouting character fails to spot some enemies, the GM may call for an agility roll to remain hidden from those enemies, otherwise the scouting character will likely be spotted and alert the enemies to the group’s presence.</p>

<h3 id="entertaining">Entertaining</h3>

<p>A character who chooses to entertain the group during makes the experience more enjoyable for characters with similar sensibilities. When deciding to entertain the group, each character should choose a personality trait, to describe the nature of the entertainment.</p>

<p>Entertainment might take the form of a bold retelling of a heroic story, subtle banter and wordplay, an idealistic debate about philosophy, a pragmatic discussion of loot earned or rewards to come, a serious discussion of future plans and tactics, or a carefree musical performance. Any character, even one with any opposite personality trait, may attempt any kind of entertainment.</p>

<p>The GM will call for a simple (TN 6) influence roll of the associated personality trait to see if the entertainment was enjoyable. If the group’s spirits are especially high or low, the GM may adjust the difficulty of the roll to easy(TN 3) or difficult (TN 9), respectively.</p>

<p>If the roll is successful, then any character who has the matching personality trait is relieved of one point of stress at the end of the day. Characters with personality traits opposed to the entertainment might grumble and complain, but aren’t affected for better or worse. Even characters who are scouting or foraging will return to the group often enough to receive the benefits.</p>

<h3 id="foraging">Foraging</h3>

<p>A character who decides to forage is looking for resources while traveling. This includes hunting wild game, searching for edible plants, and a foraging character may even find useful crafting ingredients. If the group doesn’t know of any reliable water sources on their journey, foraging for water is especially important.</p>

<p>When a character spends the day foraging, the GM will call for a cunning talent roll to see what they find, with a difficulty based on the scarcity or abundance or resources in the area. Many locations will have a list that lets the GM determine what a successful day’s foraging yields, described in the GM Guidelines chapter below. Successful foraging will most often give supplies and access to water for the day.</p>

<h2 id="resting">Resting</h2>

<p>Characters need about eight hours of sleep each night. If a character gets less, they may become stressed, as detailed in the Stress and Affliction chapter below. If characters want to take turns keeping watch for the night, then the whole process including making a breaking camp and eating dinner and breakfast, takes about 12 hours.</p>

<p>Once a character gets their nightly sleep, they recover from one point of stress. Staying in a cozy but modest dwelling might relieve an additional point of stress, while sleeping in a warm soft inn might relieve three in total. However, sleeping in a cold dank cave might cause as much stress as it relieves, and trying to sleep outside in a storm may cause even more.</p>

<p>Almost anything can be broken with enough time and the right tools. If players have the right tools for the job and no shortage of time, then these rules need not be used, and the characters may simply damage or destroy an object. However, when time is short or damaging an object may cause a commotion, these guidelines may be useful. Objects in character’s inventory or held objects can’t normally be damaged while the character is fighting back.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-with-damage">Breaking with Damage</h3>

<p>Inanimate and unattended objects can be damaged and destroyed when they have been dealt enough damage. There are two ways to deal damage to an object; brawn talent rolls and attacks. When a character attempts a brawn roll to damage an object, they quite simply deal damage to the object equal to the result of the roll. Such brawn rolls typically take one action, and boons or banes may be applied as normal.</p>

<p>Objects can also take damage from attacks just like characters. However, objects always take damage from the yield of an attack, never the attack’s threat. Any other effects of the attack or yield may or may not apply to the object at the GM’s discretion.</p>

<p>However, all objects have armor, which reduces the amount of damage they take both from attacks and brawn rolls. Attacks or abilities that ignore a target’s armor don’t ignore an object’s armor unless they specifically say so. An object’s armor is based on its material, as show in the table below.</p>

<p>The GM may also decide that some brawn rolls or attacks using the right tool might be especially destructive, while using the wrong tool might be harmless. A destructive attack or brawn roll deals double damage, before considering armor, while a harmless attempt does nothing. Ranged attacks are usually harmless against objects.</p>

<p>For example, if a character tries burning through a wooden door with a fire attack, the GM may say that is especially destructive. If the attack does 8 damage, that would be doubled to 16, then reduced by armor to 6; enough to burn through over half an inch of the wood.</p>

<p>The amount of damage it takes to break an object is called durability, and is based on the object’s thickness at its thinnest point. For example, a one-inch thick door is just as easy to break no matter how broad it is, but a tree gets more difficult to break the thicker it gets. An object’s durability is equal 1 point of damage per 1/10th inch (1/4th cm) of thickness, regardless of material.</p>

<p>However, trying to break objects with sudden violent force is not without risk. Weather breaking with a brawn roll or an attack, the fate dice will also be rolled. When they roll doom, then the character trying to break the object may suffer stress, the tool being used may become damaged itself, or other consequences may befall the characters.</p>

<p>Players should consider these risks before attempting to break an object. Breaking an object will probably cause a lot of noise as well, which may increase the doom pool if done in an area that is dangerous or deadly.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-eventually">Breaking Eventually</h3>

<p>If players choose not to risk breaking the object suddenly and violently, they may choose to dismantle an object slowly but steadily.</p>

<p>If a character has a tool that is destructive against the object in question, like an axe for chopping wood or a pickaxe for mining stone, then they may automatically reduce the objects durability by one per round, ignoring armor. If a character has a tool that is less effective but might still work, like a metal file for cutting through an iron bar, they may reduce the durability by one over a minute instead of a round.</p>

<p>This still makes a lot of noise, and may generate doom in hostile territory. Spending time itself may also lead to doom, as described above. If breaking an object takes a long time, the GM may increase the doom pool for the noise as often as doom is added for time. However, breaking an object this way carries little risk of damaging the tool used or the character using it.</p>

<h3 id="damaged-objects">Damaged Objects</h3>

<p>Many effects of a damaged object are obvious; a damaged door no longer blocks passage, a damaged wagon can’t roll, and so on. Equipment can also be damaged, however damage to equipment can usually be repaired. In extreme cases, like a blade snapped entirely in half, the object may be considered destroyed beyond repair.</p>

<p>A damaged weapon suffers a bane on all attack actions. Damaged armor provides two fewer points of armor, possibly zero. Other damaged equipment can’t be used and doesn’t provide any of its benefits or abilities. Legendary items are no exception and may become damaged or even destroyed as well. However, even if a legendary symbol is broken, the legend itself will remain and find a new symbol in time.</p>

<p>A damaged object can usually be repaired during Downtime, as described below. Adventuring supplies normally include everything needed to repair equipment, such as whetstones to polish out nicks from blades, hammers and spare rivets, plates, and chain links for armor, needle and thread for cloth, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-effects">Environmental Effects</h2>

<p>Many strange and exotic environments can affect characters’ skills. A torrential downpour might dowse fire skills, a parched desert may dry up water skills, and the tangled rigging of a ship might hamper skills.</p>

<p>Heavy rain might cause characters to be intractable wet.</p>

<h2 id="lifting--dragging">Lifting &amp; Dragging</h2>

<p>Over long distances, a character’ carrying capacity in bulk is equal to four plus double their brawn. For a brief time, a character can push, pull, lift or drag an object of bulk equal to five times their carrying capacity, or 10 times if the object can be rolled. If a character wants to move something even heavier, the GM will call for a brawn talent roll.</p>
