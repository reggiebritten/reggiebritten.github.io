<h2 id="swimming">Swimming</h2>

<p>Deep water is considered <a href="...html#special-terrain\wet-terrain">wet terrain</a>, so you must spend two points of movement to move each space. The GM wonâ€™t usually call for a roll for swimming across placid water. But swimming against turbulent water, while carrying a lot of gear, or while under attack will usually take a <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">brawn</a> <a href="...html#rolls">roll</a>. If you fail this roll, you might be carried away by the current or even sink. Several rules apply to <a href="...html#combat\combat-in-water">fighting</a> in or under water.</p>
