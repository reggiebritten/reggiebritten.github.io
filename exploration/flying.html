<h2 id="flying">Flying</h2>

<p>Many mythical creatures possess the power of flight. A flying creature must spend two movement points for ever space it ascends, but may move two spaces downward for each point of movement. A flying creature ignores most <a href="...html#special-terrain">special terrain</a>.</p>

<p>A flying creature that becomes <a href="...html#conditions\kneeling">kneeling</a> immediately falls five spaces, and a creature that becomes <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a> falls ten spaces. They fall that same distance at the end of each of their turns as long as the conditions persist. Any flying creature without the hover skill must use a movement skill each turn, or it falls five spaces. However, all flying creatures can partially control their fall. If they hit the ground, they treat the <a href="falling.md">fall</a> as if it were half the distance.</p>
