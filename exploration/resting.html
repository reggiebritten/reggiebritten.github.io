<h2 id="resting">Resting</h2>

<p>Characters need about eight hours of sleep each night. If you and your group take turns keeping watch, the whole rest lasts 10 hours, or 12 if you also make and break camp in the wilderness. You also expend one of your <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#supplies">supplies</a> each day away from comfort, representing the food and other consumables you used. You will suffer <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a> if you get significantly less sleep or run out of supplies.</p>

<p>After a supper and a nightâ€™s sleep, you recover from one point of stress. Staying in a cozy but modest dwelling might relieve an additional point of stress, while sleeping in a warm soft inn might relieve three in total. However, sleeping in a cold dank cave might cause as much stress as it relieves, and trying to sleep outside in a storm may cause even more.</p>
