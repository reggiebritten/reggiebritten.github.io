<h2 id="climbing">Climbing</h2>

<p>Climbing up an easy structure like a ladder typically doesn’t require a roll. However, the GM will usually call for a <a href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> <a href="rolls.html">roll</a> to climb up a rope, tree, or cliff or other surface. You can use a movement <a href="skills.html">skill</a> to climb, but you must spend an extra point of movement for every space you climb. In general, you can’t use <a href="skills.html#action">actions</a> while climbing, although the GM may make exceptions. You can’t <a href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defend</a> against <a href="skills.html#attack">attacks</a> while you’re climbing; you must <a href="combat.html#yield">yield</a> to any attack.</p>
