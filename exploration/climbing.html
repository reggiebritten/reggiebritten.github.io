<h2 id="climbing">Climbing</h2>

<p>Climbing up an easy structure like a ladder typically doesn’t require a roll, but the GM will usually call for a <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">brawn</a> <a href="...html#rolls">roll</a> to climb up a rope, tree, or cliff or other surface. You can use a movement <a href="...html#skills">skill</a> to climb, but you must spend two points of movement for every space you climb. In general, you can’t use <a href="...html#skills\action">actions</a> while climbing, although the GM may make exceptions. You can’t <a href="...html#combat\defending-vs-yielding">defend</a> against <a href="...html#skills\attack">attacks</a> while you’re climbing; you must <a href="...html#combat\yield">yield</a> to any attack.</p>
