<h2 id="sight--darkness">Sight &amp; Darkness</h2>

<p>The GM will describe the amount of light in each area as either <strong>bright</strong>, <strong>dim</strong>, or <strong>dark</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Daylight, torches, and campfires all cast bright light, which imposes no penalties or modifications. On a clear day with no obstructions, you can see out to 3 miles or 5km away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An starry night in an open field or the border of a fire may be dim light. All skills suffer a <a href="...html#skills\bane">bane</a> when targeting a character in darkness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A dark area, such as a the depths of a cave or a midnight forest, is devoid of light. Most characters can’t see in darkness, meaning you can’t even target other characters with <a href="...html#skills">skills</a>. If you move more than one space in a turn without being able to see where you are going, you risk bumping into something, making noise and suffering <a href="...html#stress">stress</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
