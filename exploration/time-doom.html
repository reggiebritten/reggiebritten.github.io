<h2 id="doom">Doom</h2>

<p>Time is not on the side of the heroes. The longer you take to complete an adventure, the more your enemies will be prepared and the greater the chance for disaster. Doom is a resource that the GM will spend to cause problems for the players, the more doom the GM gets, the tougher things will be. The GM gains doom when players dawdle in dangerous locations or attract unwanted attention.
The GM will describe each location that you visit as <strong>safe</strong>, <strong>wild</strong>, <strong>dangerous</strong>, or <strong>deadly</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A safe location, such as a respectable city, a well-traveled road, or a peaceful grassland, does not accumulate doom.</li>
  <li>A wild location, such as a spooky forest or craggy hills, gives the GM one point of doom for each day spent mostly in such a location.</li>
  <li>A dangerous location might be a cursed swamp, a haunted graveyard, or a forgotten ruin. The GM gains one point of doom for every hour of time spend in a dangerous location.</li>
  <li>Finally, a deadly location, such as an enemy encampment or an evil wizard’s tower, will give the GM doom for every 10 minutes passed. Heroes should spend no longer than necessary in such locations and return to safety whenever possible.
When time is critical, such as right before a villain’s plans comes to completion, the GM may increase the doom pool even faster, such as every minute or even every round. Other factors can increase doom as well, such as letting an enemy escape to warn its allies or making a loud commotion that might attract attention.</li>
</ul>
