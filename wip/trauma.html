<h3 id="optional-rule-trauma">Optional Rule: Trauma</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most dire of afflictions may not always heal on their own. If an affliction is traumatic, then it isnâ€™t removed even after the stress associated with it has been healed. A traumatic injury might be permanent damage such as a chopped off hand, while a traumatic mental affliction might represent a deep and unresolved issue. Characters may need to see exotic healing magic or confront their inner demons to resolve their trauma. Forge of Legends is designed to be an optimistic game where nothing can keep the heroes down for long; using trauma regularly is not recommended for most groups. However, it can be used if desired or if there is a need to describe a permanent injury.</p>
