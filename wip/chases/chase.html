<h2 id="pursuit">Pursuit</h2>

<p>When faced with an overwhelming enemy, there is often no choice left but to flee. These rules for pursuit should be used when ever one character or group attempts to escape the pursuit of another.</p>

<p>The GM will start by identifying which character or group is the <strong>pursued</strong>, attempting to escape, and who is the <strong>pursuer</strong>, attempting to catch them. If both sides intend to apprehend each other, the rules for combat should probably be used instead. Next, the GM will determine the <strong>gap</strong> between the pursued and the pursuer(s). This gap is the number of spaces between the two along the most obvious path. For example, if characters are 30 feet across a narrow ravine with a bridge 20 feet away, the GM would typically set the gap at 14 spaces; 4 to get to the bridge, 6 to cross it, and another 4 to get to the pursued’s starting location (jumping across would be a <strong>shortcut</strong>, detailed below).</p>

<p>The details of the <strong>pursued,</strong> <strong>pursuer</strong>, and <strong>gap</strong> may depend on the circumstances. For example, if the heroes want to catch just one member of an enemy group to question them, then the GM would likely set the gap as the number of spaces to the nearest enemy. On the other hand, if the heroes want to make sure none of the enemy group escape to warn their accomplices, then GM would likely set the gap as the distance to the furthest enemy. Multiple character starting from different locations may have their own gaps to their pursued targets. The GM may always increase or decrease the gap(s) as such circumstances change.</p>

<p>Once the gap between the pursuer and the pursued is established, the first round of the pursuit begins! Each character makes an <strong>agility</strong> roll; the pursuer subtracts their roll from the gap, while the pursued adds their roll to the gap. Unlike combat, all pursuit rolls and actions are made at the same time.If the remaining gap is zero or less, the pursuer has caught the pursued and may knock them to the ground! If there is a gap remaining at the end of the round, the chase goes on and another round begins.</p>

<p>A character may continue the pursuit for a number of rounds equal to their <strong>brawn</strong>. After that number of rounds, that character runs out of stamina and can no longer keep up. If all of the pursuers run out of stamina, the pursued inevitably escapes; if the pursued runs out of stamina, they are inevitably caught.</p>

<p>On each round of the pursuit, each character may also roll the fate die. If they roll above their fated action threshold, they may invoke a discounted twist of fate as normal.</p>

<p>Quarry gets away if the set an obstacle that the pursuers can’t overcome.</p>

<p>The pursuers goal is, of course, to catch the pursued. THe pursueds goal, on the other hand, is to <strong>escape</strong>.</p>

<p>Getting to a location the pursuers can’t acess, such as rowing away in the lost boat or crossing a rope bridge then cutting it.</p>

<p>Hiding and slipping away unnoticed, such as a slipping unnoticed into the sewer system or mingling with an unsuspecting crowd.</p>

<p>Finding backup or encountering something else that would cause the pursuers to rethink their pursuit.</p>

<p>A character’s skills may also play a role in a pursuit. It is assumed that all characters involved in a chase are using the dash maneuver twice a turn to run as fast as possible, and the bonus speed granted by their agility is represented by the bonus to their agility roll made during the chase. Using other skills risks falling behind in the chase; if a character uses an action or maneuver other than dash, the gap shifts three [placeholder] spaces against them and they can’t add their agility to their pursuit roll that turn. However, the GM may adjust the gap if the skill lets them move or resolve other effects of the skill as appropriate.</p>

<p>These chase rules can also be used when two or more character are all racing to reach a goal before the others.</p>

<p>The pursued might also be an object or a location, such as a runaway wagon or a magical artifact.</p>
