<h2 id="influence-rolls-wip">Influence Rolls <strong>WIP</strong></h2>

<p>Player character will often need to persuade NPCs to assist them with their adventures. Sometimes, an NPC is eager and willing to do what they can. But when an NPC or group of NPCs is reluctant to help, influence challenges may change their perspective. The GM will call for an influence challenge when a character attempts to change the mind of an NPC or group of NPCs that is uncooperative. Only NPCs can be affected by influence challenges; players may always decide for themselves how their character thinks and reacts.</p>

<p>First, the DM should consider the NPC or group’s objections; their reasons for being unwilling to cooperate with the request. An objection could be that the NPC wants something in return, they fear the consequences of cooperating, or they just plain don’t like the character. If the NPC has no objections, then they would cooperate and no influence challenge in needed.</p>

<p>Next the GM should decide the NPC’s patience, representing how long they will listen to the characters before refusing to listen more. For simple interactions with simple NPCs, the NPC might only have one objection and one patience, giving the players just one chance at success or failure. But more intricate and nuanced NPCs might have more. Finally, the GM should decide the NPC’s personality traits or use traits that have already been established. The GM typically won’t reveal an NPCs objections, patience, and personality to the players right away, but the NPC’s words and actions will provide hints during the conversation.</p>

<p>The player’s goal with influence rolls are to overcome all the NPC’s objections before they run out of patience. The players should describe what their character says and does to persuade the NPC. Then the GM will decide which personality trait most closely matches the character’s words and actions, and assign the roll a target number. If the NPC</p>

<p>Often when an NPC runs out of patience, that is the end of the conversation. However, character can attempt to increase an NPC’s patience by offering them new information relevant to the conversation.</p>

<p>For example, a guard may have run out of patience with the players simply asking to be let past. But if one of the players offers a generous bribe, the guard may be willing to reconsider their proposition. Other new information that may increase an NPC’s patience could include sharing a scandalous rumor, a previously unnoticed benefit for the NPC, or a threat against something important to them. Most importantly, whatever is brought up must be relevant to the conversation and new. If it is irrelevant or if the NPC has already been informed, then their patience does not increase.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, an NPC’s patience may decrease if they feel that they have been treated rudely or unfairly, or if they would rather avoid the subject of the conversation. Saying the wrong thing can end a conversation just as surely as a failed influence roll.</p>
