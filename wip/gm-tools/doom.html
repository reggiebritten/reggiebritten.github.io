<h2 id="doom">Doom</h2>

<p>The doom pool represents long term complications that impose obstacles between them and their goals. Many things can generate doom, such as failing challenges, dawdling in dangerous locales, and the machinations of the villains. The GM Guidelines section dictates how the GM can use doom, but it will always be used to cause problems for the players. Players should try their best to minimize the amount of doom the GM accrues.</p>
