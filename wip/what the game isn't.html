<h2 id="what-the-game-isnt">What the Game Isn’t</h2>

<p>Forge of Legends shares many features in common with other tabletop roleplaying games. However, experienced gamers may have some expectations that don’t apply to this game in specific.</p>

<p>For one, characters don’t get much more powerful as they gain experience. A character’s abilities almost never increase, and neither do their defenses. Instead, most of a character’s progression comes from gaining more options, not more power. Think of this game like a collectable card game, where you can always get more cards, but you can only use so many at a time, and none is stronger by design.</p>

<p>While characters have different talents, all characters are intelligent and admirable in their own way. Some character’s might have more “book smarts” while others have more “street smarts,” but every character knows something the others don’t. While a flamboyant bard might fit in at the king’s court, the strong silent type might earn more respect from an orcish war chief.</p>

<p>In terms of combat, no attack simply “misses” its target. While is possible for an attack’s damage to be reduced to zero, any other effects of the attack still occur. Skills in combat will almost always do something.</p>

<p>Lastly, Forge of legends is a cooperative game. Some groups may enjoy a friendly rivalry, and players may even test their mettle against one another in a duel if both agree (and only if both agree!). But in the end, all the players are working together to achieve their goal.</p>
