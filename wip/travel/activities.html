<h2 id="travel-activities">Travel Activities</h2>

<p>While traveling, heroes can undertake additional activities that help them on their adventure. The three travel activities are scouting, entertaining, and foraging. When beginning travel each day, each character should pick one travel activity to do during the day. Multiple scouts, entertainers, or foragers follow the rules for group rolls described above.</p>

<p>Trailblazing
Hauling
Scouting
Hunting
Gathering
Nagivating
Provisioning - prevent supply loss by crating, etc
Relaxing
Utility - set your own specific priotiry, such as keeping an item safe or decypering directions, managing enviromental hazards like quicksand. Gain a boon on all relevant checks. make a map</p>

<p>Guard? Scare off wild animals / bandits? first into action when dangert arises?</p>

<p>Who remains alert for being followed? Who covers tracks.
Who finds ruins, campsites, monster signs, etc?</p>

<p>Forecast = predict weather</p>

<p>character roles will dictate where they are if a giht breaks out - trailblazers and scounts will generally lead the way, with navigators close behind. Hunters and foragers will ghenerally be to the side and a little off the beaten path looking for resouirces. Hauler’s provisioners, and relaxers will generally be in the back taking care of or partaking in supplies.</p>

<p>While the navigator helps their group stay on tack (often literally) toward thier goal, a scout looks out for potential dangers.</p>

Make table of navigation TNs</p>

<p>A scouting character stays a bit away from the main group to keep a lookout for hazards, enemies, tracks, or to make sure the group doesn’t get lost. If any of those challenges present themselves during the day’s travel, the GM will call for the scouting character to make a cunning talent roll, with a target number determined by the nature of the problem.</p>

<p>If the scouting character succeeds, they recognize the challenge before it becomes a problem. They will spot a hazards or enemies from a distance a distance, correctly follow tracks, and keep the group on track.</p>

<p>However, if the scouting character fails the roll, they don’t notice the problem until it is too late. They may not notice hazard or enemies until the group stumbles into them, they may lose whatever tracks they were following for the day, or the group may become lost. If the scouting character fails to spot some enemies, the GM may call for an agility roll to remain hidden from those enemies, otherwise the scouting character will likely be spotted and alert the enemies to the group’s presence.</p>

<h3 id="entertaining">Entertaining</h3>

<p>A character who chooses to entertain the group during makes the experience more enjoyable for characters with similar sensibilities. When deciding to entertain the group, each character should choose a personality trait, to describe the nature of the entertainment.</p>

<p>Entertainment might take the form of a bold retelling of a heroic story, subtle banter and wordplay, an idealistic debate about philosophy, a pragmatic discussion of loot earned or rewards to come, a serious discussion of future plans and tactics, or a carefree musical performance. Any character, even one with any opposite personality trait, may attempt any kind of entertainment.</p>

<p>The GM will call for a simple (TN 6) influence roll of the associated personality trait to see if the entertainment was enjoyable. If the group’s spirits are especially high or low, the GM may adjust the difficulty of the roll to easy(TN 3) or difficult (TN 9), respectively.</p>

<p>If the roll is successful, then any character who has the matching personality trait is relieved of one point of stress at the end of the day. Characters with personality traits opposed to the entertainment might grumble and complain, but aren’t affected for better or worse. Even characters who are scouting or foraging will return to the group often enough to receive the benefits.</p>

<h3 id="foraging">Foraging</h3>

<p>A character who decides to forage is looking for resources while traveling. This includes hunting wild game, searching for edible plants, and a foraging character may even find useful crafting ingredients. If the group doesn’t know of any reliable water sources on their journey, foraging for water is especially important.</p>

<p>When a character spends the day foraging, the GM will call for a cunning talent roll to see what they find, with a difficulty based on the scarcity or abundance or resources in the area. Many locations will have a list that lets the GM determine what a successful day’s foraging yields, described in the GM Guidelines chapter below. Successful foraging will most often give supplies and access to water for the day.</p>
