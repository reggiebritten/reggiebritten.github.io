<h2 id="overland-travel-wip">Overland Travel #WIP</h2>

<p>The heroes’ adventures will often take them to far off and exotic locations. To get there will likely take days or even weeks of travel. How long it takes and how much stress the travelers suffer depends mostly on the terrain and the weather, but mounts, vehicles and ships may make the journey easier or faster.
In general, travel time is measured in days, where a typical day’s travel consists of about 10 hours walking, 4 hours resting, cooking and camping, and 10 hours sleeping and keeping lookout. However, the GM may present certain challenges, like crossing a dangerous river or descending a steep canyon, as individual encounters separate from the normal day’s travel.
Stress accumulated from terrain or weather is applied to all characters in the group at the end of the day’s travel. If terrain or weather reduces the distance traveled to zero, then no progress is made that day but stress will still accrue. The stress of travel only applies to character actually traveling overland, not characters resting in place. Characters accumulating too much stress may need to stop and rest for a day or two before continuing. Character may also use travel activities and some downtime activities, detailed below, while resting for a day.
Whether traveling or resting for a day in the wilderness, characters will likely come across one or more encounters. Some of these encounters may be benign, a few may even be beneficial, but many will pose challenges the players must overcome. The larger the doom pool, the worse each encounter is likely to be, as described in the GM Guidelines chapter.
Traveling through a wild location is likely to increase the doom pool, so characters may prefer to avoid such places if they have the luxury of time. However, when time is scarce, taking the long way around may accrue even more doom.
The GM may rule that some abilities can’t be used in certain types of terrain and weather. Water abilities may fail in parched deserts and fire abilities may fizzle in a torrential downpour.</p>

<h3 id="terrain">Terrain</h3>

<p>Terrain is the type of landscape the characters are traveling through, and it has the biggest impact on how far they can travel and how difficult the journey is.
A list of terrain types, normal travel distance, and stress per day are show in the table below. Woods, shrubland, hills and roads all modify the distance and/or stress of the journey, in addition to whatever terrain type they are a part of. A road can never reduce the stress form traveling below zero.
| Travel  Time &amp; Stress by Terrain &amp; Weather |                              |                |

<h3 id="weather">Weather</h3>

<p>The weather while traveling can have just as much effect as the terrain. The weather is described in one of four terms: clear weather, foul weather, mild storm, and severe storm.</p>

<p>Clear weather is a sunny or cloudy day with no precipitation, it has no effect on travel speed or stress. Foul weather might be light rain or snow, a heat wave, or a cold snap. Foul weather decreases travel distance for the day by five miles and increases the stress for traveling by one.</p>

<p>A mild storm might describe a rainstorm, or a light blizzard or dust storm. Traveling during a mild storm is not recommended, the travel distance is reduced by 10 and characters suffer five stress if they choose to travel that day. Characters who aren’t traveling may even suffer three stress if they can’t manage to find shelter from the storm.</p>

<p>A severe storm is a thunderstorm, hurricane, or an extreme blizzard or dust storm. Travel is impossible, and any character exposed to the elements suffers one stress per hour. Some weather, like tornadoes and supernatural storms, may have even more immediate and dangerous consequences.</p>

<p>Some pieces of equipment like warm or cool clothing can help protect against the weather.</p>

<h3 id="forced-march">Forced March</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when speed is of the essence, characters can push themselves to travel further than normal. Characters can choose to travel up to double the normal travel distance, however they suffer one stress for each 1/5th of the day’s normal travel distance.</p>

<p>For example, characters may choose to travel up to 30 miles through hilly plains, but they suffer one stress for each three miles traveled beyond the first 15.</p>

<h3 id="mounts">Mounts</h3>

<p>Mounts, such as horses, make travel easier and more convenient over long distances. A horse or donkey can carry much more bulk than a person.</p>

<p>With proper pack saddles, a donkey can carry 50 bulk, a horse, mule, or camel can carry about 100 bulk,  and an ox can carry 150 bulk, not including a rider. A horse, mule, camel, or ox needs to eat five supplies per day, and a donkey eats one. However, these animals can usually forage for food where grass is plentiful.</p>

<p>Mounts are also more comfortable, a character traveling mounted suffers one less stress per day from traveling through any terrain. However, mounted travel doesn’t protect against the effects of weather. Mounts themselves may become stressed and suffer afflictions if taken to extreme environments or not cared for.</p>

<p>While many mounts are capable sprinters, they aren’t much faster over the course of a day. Even with mounts, a group’s overland speed is limited by terrain according to the above table. If time is of the essence, a mount may cover the entire day’s travel in half the time, but that would be very stressful for the mount and it couldn’t go any further that day.</p>

<h3 id="vehicles--ships">Vehicles &amp; Ships</h3>

<p>Wagons, Carriages, and Ships can all make travel more comfortable. A wagon or carriage reduces the stress of both terrain and weather by one per day. They also double the amount that the pack animal pulling them can carry. However, wagons and carriages travel 5 miles    (8 km) per day more slowly even on roads, and 10 miles (16 km) more slowly where there isn’t a road.</p>

<p>Large sailing ships can travel around 100 miles per day, depending on their size and construction. Prevailing winds may increase or decrease this speed depending on their direction. Travel aboard a large ship is not very stressful, even stormy weather may only cause one stress per day. However, a terrible storm may damage the ship itself. A rowboat travels only five miles per day in still water and doesn’t protect against the weather.</p>
