<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>

<p>Once you’ve all made your characters, you are ready to begin playing! Fundamentally, playing forge of legends is simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The GM describes the scene, and any details that you see, hear, and know about the situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You say what your character will try to do, and how they will try to do it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GM tells you which rules apply, and what any obvious possible outcomes may be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you accept the risks or costs, you may attempt the chosen activity. Otherwise, you may try something else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GM uses the rules to determine the outcomes and consequences of your actions, and describes the new situation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can cooperate with your allies to attempt to do anything you can think of in the game world, but you will often be offered a quest or goal by the GM. These goals will often take you to exotic and dangerous locales, where you must defeat fearsome enemies to save the day. However, you are encouraged to look for unorthodox and creative solutions to problems, that’s the stuff that legends are made of!</p>
