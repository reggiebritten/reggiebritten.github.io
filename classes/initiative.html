<h3 id="initiative">Initiative</h3>
<p>Each of your movements is carefully planned to keep you one stead ahead of your enemies. This tempo is represented by <strong>initiative</strong>, a resource you can save up and spend for devastating effects. You gain access to <strong>initiative</strong> skills, and you can ready them in you <a class = "keyword" href="classes.html#fighting-style">fighting style</a> like any other skills. In addition, you can ready any two initiative skills as <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#bonus">bonus</a> skills. <br />
Keep track of your initiative as you gain and spend it; you must spend initiative to use skills with an initiative cost. You must be aware of an enemy to plan your tactics; your initiative returns to 0 when there are no obvious enemies nearby.</p>
