<p>No matter how many <a href="...html#skills">skills</a> you know, you can only keep so many tactics ready to use at a moment’s notice. These few skills are considered <strong>ready</strong> in your fighting style. You can have a combined total of four <a href="...html#skills\action">actions</a> and <a href="...html#skills\maneuvers">maneuvers</a>, readied at once. You can also have a combined total of four <a href="...html#skills\reaction">reactions</a> and <a href="...html#skills\passive">passive</a> skills readied. Certain effects might also grant you <a href="...html#skills\bonus">bonus</a> skills, which can be readied without counting against these totals. Your class’s core feature, your permanent skills, and skills that come from your equipment don’t count against the number of skill you can have readied. You can rearrange which skills you have readied over 10 minutes, during which time you can also change your <a href="...html#equipment\slots">equipment</a>.</p>
