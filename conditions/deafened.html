You loose your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and attacks against you while you’re both deafened and <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#surrounded">surrounded</a> gain an additional <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#boons">boon</a>. <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#sound">Sound</a> skills are ineffective on a deafened character, and enemies gain a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boon</a> on <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">rolls</a> made to sneak around if you’re the only person who might notice them.</p>
