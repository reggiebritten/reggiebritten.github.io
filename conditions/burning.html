<p>A burning character is on fire. At the start of your turn roll 1d4 and loose that much <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> and that much <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>. This defense loss is not affected by armor and never carries over to another defense if one is depleted. If your poise and focus are both 0, you suffer one stress at the start of your turn instead. While you are burning, you shed dim light out to one pace away.</p>
