<h3 id="elemental">Elemental</h3>

<p>An elemental condition harnesses the power of one of the primal elements. Elemental conditions also have a skill tag that denotes which specific element they represent. If you are <a href="skills.html#immune">immune</a> to that elemental tag, you are also immune to that elemental condition. For example, if you are immune to the <a href="skills.html#fire">fire</a> tag, you are also immune to the <a href="conditions.html#burning">burning</a> condition.</p>
