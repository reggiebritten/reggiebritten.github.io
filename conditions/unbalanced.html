<h3 id="unbalanced">Unbalanced</h3>

<p>An unbalanced character is having difficulty finding their footing. You suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> on all <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> based skills, and you canâ€™t <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">dodge</a> attacks. An unbalanced <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#minions-defense">minion</a> must yield to attacks. You lose your zone of control.</p>
