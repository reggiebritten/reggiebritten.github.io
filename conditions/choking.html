<p><strong><a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#bodily">Bodily</a></strong></p>

<p>A choking character is coughing, drowning, or otherwise unable to catch their breath. At the start of your turn, you loose -2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> and -2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>. This defense loss is not affected by armor and never carries over to another defense if one is depleted. If your focus and momentum are both 0, you suffer one stress at the start of your turn instead. You canâ€™t use <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#sound">sound</a> skills that involve speaking or shouting. A character who is unable to breath for several rounds will eventually suffer <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>, as described in the <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#breath-holding">breath holding</a> section.</p>
