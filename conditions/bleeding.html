<h3 id="bleeding">Bleeding</h3>

<p><strong><a href="bodily.md">Bodily</a></strong></p>

<p>A bleeding character is rapidly losing blood. At the start of your turn, you loose -2 <a href="...html#combat\momentum">momentum</a> and -2 <a href="...html#combat\poise">poise</a>. This defense loss is not affected by armor, and never carries over to another defense if one is depleted. If your momentum and poise are both 0, you suffer one stress at the start of your turn instead.</p>
