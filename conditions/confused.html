<p>A confused character’s <a href="...html#combat\focus">focus</a> has been reduced to zero, and they have lost track of the battle around them. While confused, you can’t gain focus, you loose your <a href="...html#combat\zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and all your skills target a random character within the skill’s range.</p>
