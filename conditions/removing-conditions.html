<h2 id="removing-conditions">Removing Conditions</h2>

<p>All conditions, except for those with the <a href="persistent.md">persistent</a> tag, can be removed by using the <a class="item" data-name="Recovery">Recovery</a> skill. Furthermore, <a href="temporary.md">temporary</a> conditions are automatically removed from you after your action or your turn. The <a href="blessed.md">blessed</a> condition can also help remove non-persistent conditions.</p>

<h3 id="replacing-conditions">Replacing Conditions</h3>

<p>Many conditions will be overwritten by specific other conditions when they are applied, in addition to any other effects. For example, if you are <a href="burning.md">burning</a>, then you become <a href="wet.md">wet</a>, then the burning condition in immediately removed from you. Even <a href="persistent.md">persistent</a> conditions can be replaced.</p>
