<h3 id="persistent">Persistent</h3>

<p>A persistent condition cannot be removed by typical means, Including the <a class="item" data-name="Recovery">Recovery</a> skill or the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#blessed">blessed</a> condition. Persistent conditions can only be removed by effects that specifically name that condition. Some conditions are innately persistent, while others can be temporarily made persistent by other effects.</p>
