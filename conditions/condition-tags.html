<h2 id="condition-tags">Condition Tags</h2>

<p>Many conditions have tags that describe how they work and interact with other parts of the game.</p>

<h3 id="persistent">Persistent</h3>

<p>A persistent condition cannot be removed by typical means, Including the <a class="item" data-name="Recovery">Recovery</a> skill or the <a href="blessed.md">blessed</a> condition. Persistent conditions can only be removed by effects that specifically name that condition. Some conditions are innately persistent, while others can be temporarily made persistent by other effects.</p>

<h3 id="temporary">Temporary</h3>

<p>A temporary condition is automatically removed from you after your next <a href="...html#skills\action">action</a>, or after you use an extra <a href="...html#skills\maneuvers">maneuver</a> instead of your action. A temporary condition that is granted during an action is not removed until the next action after that one. Temporary conditions applied to legendary characters on your turn are removed after your next ally’s action, instead of the next action of the legendary character.</p>
