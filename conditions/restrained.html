<p>A restrained character is held in place by some object such as a net or chain. You can’t move or be <a href="...html#combat\shoving">shoved</a>, and you lose you <a href="...html#combat\zone-of-control">zone of control</a>. The restraints must be removed in order to free you. This will usually require a <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">brawn</a> <a href="...html#rolls">roll</a> to break the restraints, as determined by the GM. Usually such a roll may be made as part of any skill that would let you move, and if you succeed you may use that skill’s movement.</p>
