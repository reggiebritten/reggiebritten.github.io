<p>A restrained character is held in place by some object such as a net or chain. You can’t move or be <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#shoving">shoved</a>, and you lose you <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>. The restraints must be removed in order to free you. This will usually require a <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> to break the restraints, as determined by the GM. Usually such a roll may be made as part of any skill that would let you move, and if you succeed you may use that skill’s movement.</p>
