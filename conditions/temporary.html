<h3 id="temporary">Temporary</h3>

<p>A temporary condition is automatically removed from you after your next <a href="skills.html#actions">action</a>, or after you use an extra <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a> instead of your action. A temporary condition that is granted during an action is not removed until the next action after that one. Temporary conditions applied to legendary characters on your turn are removed after your next allyâ€™s action, instead of the next action of the legendary character.</p>
