<h3 id="kneeling">Kneeling</h3>

<p>A kneeling character has been forced down to their knees. You suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> on <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> based skills, and you canâ€™t <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">block</a> attacks. A kneeling <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#minions-defense">minion</a> must yield to attacks. You must spend an extra point of movement for each pace you move.</p>
