<p>A grabbed character is being held in place by one or more other characters. While youâ€™re grabbed, you loose your <a href="...html#combat\zone-of-control">zone of control</a> and suffer a <a href="...html#skills\bane">bane</a> on <a href="...html#skills\attack">attacks</a> against characters who are not part of the grab. If the character grabbing you is within one size of you, they also loose their zone of control and suffer a bane on characters outside the grab.</p>

<p>If you and the character grabbing you are within one <a href="...html#combat\size">size</a> of each other, then you cannot move. The character grabbing you can drag you along whenever they move, but each space they move costs an extra point of movement. If you and the character grabbing you are two or more size category apart, then the larger character may move freely and the smaller character is pulled along, regardless of who is grabbing whom.</p>

<p>If two similar sized characters grab each other, then neither can move. Characters in a grab can still be <a href="...html#combat\shoving">shoved</a>, and shoving a character out of reach removes the grabbed condition. You must usually <a href="...html#skills\concentration">concentrate</a> on a grab, and <a href="...html#skills\interrupt">interrupting</a> that concentration will free the grabbed character.</p>
