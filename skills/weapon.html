<h3 id="weapon">Weapon</h3>

<p>A weapon skill requires the user to wield the skill’s weapon in the proper way in order to use it. Two handed weapons must be wielded in both hands to use any of their skills. If a character is not proficient in a weapon, then they can only use the first half, rounded down, of that weapon’s skills.</p>
