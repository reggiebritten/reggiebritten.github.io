<h3 id="resistant">Resistant</h3>

<p>If you are resistant to a specific tag, then any <a href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> with that tag suffers a <a href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> against you. <a href="skills.html#utility">Utility</a> skills and attacks that aren’t actions are unaffected by resistance. If you are resistant to multiple tags, then each will add a bane to attacks targeting you. However, multiple sources of resistance to the same tag don’t add multiple banes.</p>
