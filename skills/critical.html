<h3 id="criticals">Criticals</h3>

<p>When exactly one die of an <a href="skills/action.md">action</a>’s challenge beat the TN, that action is a critical and gains bonus effects. Precisely which critical effects are added to the action depends on the action’s tags. For example, a critical <a href="skills/water.md">water</a> skill can make the target <a href="conditions/wet.md">wet</a>.
Some critical effects offer a vigor bonus as an alternative; if the skill is an <a href="skills/attack.md">attack</a>, that bonus is added to the damage of the <a href="combat/yield.md">yield</a>. If it is a utility skill, then one target is granted that vigor bonus. Some skills also have unique critical effects that may be chosen instead of the tags’ critical effects.</p>
