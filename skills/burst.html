<h3 id="burst">Burst</h3>

<p>A burst is a sphere that spreads out from the center a number of spaces specified by the skill. For example, a two-space burst would include the center of the area as well as all spaces up to two spaces away from the center. Bursts cannot normally go through walls, but can spread around them.
A burst can be <strong>central</strong>, <strong>point-blank</strong>, or <strong>within range</strong>. A central burst means the area of the skill must be directly centered on the character using it If a character occupies more than one space, they choose one of their spaces as the center of the burst. A point-blank burst means that at least one space of the burst must be adjacent to the character using the skill, and no space can include the character. A burst within range means that the center of the burst may be anywhere within the range of the skill. Note that the range applies to the center of the area, so it is possible for a character to be affected even beyond the listed range.</p>
