<h3 id="concentration">Concentration</h3>

<p>Some skills require your concentration to maintain their effects. While you’re concentrating on a skill, you may release your concentration any time on an ally’s turn, including your own, but not on an enemy’s.</p>

<p>Concentrating on a skill doesn’t come with any inherent cost or penalty. However, you can only concentrate on one skill at a time. If you use a second concentration skill while you are already concentrating on another one, then you must either release your concentration on the first skill or ignore the concentration effects of the second skill.</p>
