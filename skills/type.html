<h2 id="type">Type</h2>

<p>Each skill has a type that describes how long it takes to use. There are five types of skills: <strong>actions</strong>, <strong>maneuvers</strong>, <strong>reactions</strong>, <strong>passives</strong>, and <strong>others</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>

<p>Actions are often a character’s most powerful skills, including most attacks against enemies and skills to support allies. You may only use one action on your turn. Actions may benefit from your <a href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a>, <a href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a>, and/or <a href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>, depending on the action’s <a href="skills.html#targets">target</a>. After you use an action, or use a maneuver instead of your action, all <a href="conditions.html#temporary">temporary</a> <a href="conditions.html">conditions</a> are removed from you.</p>

<h3 id="maneuvers">Maneuvers</h3>

<p>Maneuvers are faster skills that let you move around the battlefield. You may only use one maneuver each turn. You can use a second maneuver instead of your <a href="skills.html#action">action</a>, but if you do, you become <a href="conditions.html#heedless">heedless</a> after the second maneuver. You may move up to your <a href="abilities.html#speed">speed</a> as part of any maneuver that isn’t <a href="skills.html#slow">slow</a>, but not maneuvers that are slow. Using a maneuver in an enemy’s <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a> risks being <a href="combat.html#hindering-maneuvers">hindered</a>, unless it it <a href="skills.html#careful">careful</a>. Your cannot use an action in the middle of a maneuver, or vice-versa.</p>

<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>

<p>You can use a reaction at any time, even during another character’s turn and interrupting another a skill. However, all reactions have a <strong>trigger</strong>, which must be met before the reaction can be used. You can use reactions as often as their triggers are met, but only once per triggering event. There is no limit to the number of reactions you may use in a round.</p>

<h3 id="passive">Passive</h3>

<p>Passive skills are always in effect; you always receives their benefits when you have them in your <a href="classes.html#fighting-style">fighting style</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>Other skills take more than one turn, and will specify how long they take to complete. You must <a href="skills.html#concentration">concentrate</a> on the skill for the duration in order to complete the skill. If your are interrupted, then nothing happens, and any resources spent on the skill are not consumed.</p>
