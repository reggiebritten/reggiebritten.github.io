<h3 id="vulnerable">Vulnerable</h3>

<p>If you are vulnerable to a specific tag, then any <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> with that tag gains a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> against you. <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#utility">Utility</a> skills and attacks that aren’t actions are unaffected by vulnerability. If you are vulnerable to multiple tags, then each will add a boon to attacks targeting you. However, multiple sources of vulnerability to the same tag don’t add multiple boons.</p>
