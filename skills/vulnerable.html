<h3 id="vulnerable">Vulnerable</h3>

<p>If you are vulnerable to a specific tag, then any <a href="skills.html#attack">attack</a> with that tag gains a <a href="skills.html#boon">boon</a> against you. <a href="skills.html#utility">Utility</a> skills and attacks that aren’t actions are unaffected by vulnerability. If you are vulnerable to multiple tags, then each will add a boon to attacks targeting you. However, multiple sources of vulnerability to the same tag don’t add multiple boons.</p>
