<h2 id="cunning-effects">Cunning Effects</h2>

<p>For each of your skill’s dice that roll below your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>, you have earned a cunning effect! The type of cunning effects you may add to the skill depend on the skill’s <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#skill-tags">skill-tags</a>, and will usually offer you a choice. For example, a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#water">water</a> cunning effect can either make the target <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#wet">wet</a> or remove a <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">condition</a> from them. If your skill has multiple tags with cunning effects, you can choose any of those options, but only one effect per successful roll. Other effects may also offer you unique options for cunning effects, which you may choose instead of cunning effects from the skill’s tags You can also <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#interrupting-concentration">interrupt</a> your target’s <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#concentration">concentration</a> as a cunning effect.</p>

<p>If your skill earns three or more cunning effects, then each successful die after the second earns you a fated effect! Describe to the GM any outcome you can imagine your skill having, and the GM will tell you if it is reasonable, and what happens.</p>
