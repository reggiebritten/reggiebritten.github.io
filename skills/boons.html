<h3 id="boons">Boons</h3>

<p>Each boon that your <a href="skills.html">skill</a> receives increases the number of dice you roll for the skill (if any) by one. Each boon also increases the skill’s <a href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> by +4 if it is an <a href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a>. If the skill doesn’t roll dice and isn’t an attack, then it is not affected by boons. Skills with multiple targets might gain a boon against each target, or only some, depending on the source of the boon.</p>
