<h3 id="boons">Boons</h3>

<p>Each boon that your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skill</a> receives increases the number of dice you roll for the skill (if any) by one. Each boon also increases the skill’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> by +4 if it is an <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a>. If the skill doesn’t roll dice and isn’t an attack, then it is not affected by boons. If an effect gives your whole skill a boon, then it gains a boon against each target. However, other effects might only give your skill a boon against specific targets, not all of them.</p>
