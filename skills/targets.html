<h2 id="targets">Targets</h2>

<p>All non-<a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#passives">passive</a> skills have a target, which describes who or what is affected by the skill. You must be able to see the target(s) of a skill, with the exception of <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#blast">blast</a> skills and skills that only target yourself. You must choose the target of a skill before any effects, costs, or attacks come into effect. Some skills also have specific rules that tell you who they target.</p>

<h3 id="utility">Utility</h3>

<p>Utility skills are the broadest category of skills, and usually aid you and your allies. You can normally target yourself with utility skills, and you are always the target of a utility skill that is neither <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ranged">ranged</a>. A utility skill is capable of affecting enemies unless it is a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#support">support</a> skill, but utility skills are never <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a>.</p>

<p>When you use a utility <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#actions">action</a> (but not <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a>), roll 2d8. Each boon or bane the skill has adjusts the number of these dice. Each die that rolls equal to or below your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a> earns you a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#cunning-effects">cunning effect</a>, in addition to the skills other effects! The total of this roll isn’t normally used.</p>

<h3 id="support">Support</h3>

<p>A support skill is useful for bolstering yourself or your allies. Support skills can only target willing characters; they automatically fail to affect an unwilling character.</p>

<h3 id="attacks">Attacks</h3>

<p>An attack skill lets you wear down your target’s defenses and ultimately defeat them. In addition to the usual features of a skill, all attacks have a <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> and a <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a>, which the target must choose between. If an attack targets multiple different characters, then each may independently choose how to respond. See the <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defending</a> section for details on what to do when you are attacked. You can’t normally attack yourself, but you might if you include yourself in a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#blast">blast</a>.</p>

<h3 id="threat">Threat</h3>

<p>The threat of the <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> represents how difficult an attack is to avoid. Each attack lists it’s base threat, and you add your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a> to that threat do determine the total threat your target must contend with. You must take an attack’s threat as damage to your choice of <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> if you want to avoid that attack’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a>, as detailed in the <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defending</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="yield">Yield</h3>

<p>An <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack’s</a> yield describes what the attack does if it is not <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defended</a> against. Each attack has a damage type (<a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>) and damage dice that you roll if the target yields. Add together all the dice to determine the amount of damage you do with the attack. If it is a  <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#thrown">thrown</a> attack, also add your  <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> to this damage. The target’s armor reduces the damage they take from an attack’s yield.</p>

<p>Furthermore, compare each individual die to your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>. Each die that rolls equal to or below your cunning earns you a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#cunning-effects">cunning effect</a>, in addition to the yield’s other effects!</p>

<h3 id="melee">Melee</h3>

<p>Your melee skills can target one character within one space of you. You can target yourself with melee <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#utility">utility</a> skills, but not <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a>. Add your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> to the <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a> damage of melee attacks.</p>

<h3 id="ranged">Ranged</h3>

<p>A ranged skill will specify a maximum range, such as “Ranged: 10”. This range is increased by your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>. A ranged skill can target one character within this maximum range. Using a ranged skill in an enemy’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a> let’s that enemy impose a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> on the skill.</p>

<h3 id="line">Line</h3>

<p>A line skill targets any space or character between two points. Many line skills will start from a space adjacent to you and extend outward to a specified range. Line skills require precision, and fail to target a character that you can’t see, even if the line passes though their space.</p>

<h3 id="blast">Blast</h3>

<p>A blast is a sphere that spreads out from the center a number of spaces specified by the skill. For example, a two-space blast would include the center of the area as well as all spaces up to two spaces away from the center. The skill targets each character or space in the area, even yourself and characters that you can’t see. Blasts cannot normally go through walls, but can spread around them.</p>

<p>A blast can be <strong>central</strong>, <strong>point-blank</strong>, or <strong>within range</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A central blast means the area of the skill must be directly centered on you. If you occupy more than one space, choose one of your spaces as the center of the blast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A point-blank blast means that at least one space of the blast must be adjacent to you, and no space can include you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A blast within range means that the center of the blast may be anywhere within the range of the skill. Note that the range applies to the center of the area, so it is possible for a character to be affected even beyond the listed range.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
