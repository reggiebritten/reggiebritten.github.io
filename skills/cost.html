<h2 id="skill-costs">Skill Costs</h2>

<p>A skill may list a type of <a href="combat/defenses.md">defenses</a> that it grants or costs when used. A positive number grants the character using it the specified amount of the specified type of defense. If the character can’t currently gain that type of defense, for example if they are <a href="combat/knocked-down.md">knocked-down</a> and trying to gain <a href="combat/momentum.md">momentum</a>, then the character may still use the skill but they gain no defense from it.
A negative number means that the skill costs defense, which must be paid before the skill can be used; this cost is unaffected by a character’s <a href="combat/armor.md">armor</a>. If the character cannot pay the cost, they cannot use the skill. If a <a href="skills/reaction.md">reaction</a> changes the character’s defense after they use the skill but before it comes into effect and leaves them unable to pay the cost, then the skill does nothing and the <a href="skills/action.md">action</a>, <a href="skills/maneuver.md">maneuver</a>, or <a href="skills/reaction.md">reaction</a> opportunity used on the skill is wasted.
A character may invoke a <a href="final%20gambit">final gambit</a> to use a skill without paying its defense cost, but doing so leaves the character drained of energy and automatically <a href="combat/defeated.md">defeated</a>.</p>
