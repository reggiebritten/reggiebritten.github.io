<h2 id="defense">Defense</h2>

<p>A skill may list a type of <a href="combat.html#defenses">defense</a> that it grants or costs when used. A positive number grants you that of defense. If you can’t currently gain that type of defense, for example if you are <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> and trying to gain <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, then you may still use the skill but you gain no defense from it.</p>

<p>A negative number means that the skill costs defense, which you must pay before you can use the skill. This cost is unaffected by your <a href="equipment.html#armor">armor</a>. If you can’t pay the cost, then you can’t use the skill. You may invoke a <a href="combat.html#final-gambit">final gambit</a> to use a skill without paying its defense cost, but doing so leaves you drained of energy and automatically <a href="combat.html#defeated">defeated</a> afterwards.</p>

<p>A skill’s defense type also determines how it interacts with some conditions, like <a href="conditions.html#kneeling">kneeling</a>, <a href="conditions.html#distracted">distracted</a>, and <a href="conditions.html#unbalanced">unbalanced</a>.</p>
