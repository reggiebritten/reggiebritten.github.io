<h3 id="interrupting">Interrupting</h3>

<p>Some effects will let you interrupt a character who is concentrating on a skill. In particular, interrupting your target’s concentration is always an option for a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#cunning-effects">cunning-effect</a>. Your concentration is automatically interrupted on one of your <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#weapon">weapon</a>’s skills if you stop holding the weapon for any reason. <br />
When you interrupt a character, any effects they were concentrating on immediately end. Some concentration effects are automatically interrupted when specific events come to pass, and some skills might do something special when they are interrupted.</p>
