<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>

<p>You can use a reaction at any time, even during another characterâ€™s turn and interrupting another a skill. However, all reactions have a <strong>trigger</strong>, which must be met before the reaction can be used. You can use reactions as often as their triggers are met, but only once per triggering event. There is no limit to the number of reactions you may use in a round.</p>
