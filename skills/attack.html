<h3 id="attack">Attack</h3>

<p>An attack skill lets you wear down your target’s defenses and ultimately defeat them. In addition to the usual features of a skill, all attacks have a <a href="...html#combat\threat">threat</a> and a <a href="...html#combat\yield">yield</a>, which the target must choose between. If an attack targets multiple different characters, then each may independently choose how to respond. See the <a href="...html#combat\defending-vs-yielding">defending</a> section for details on what to do when you are attacked. You can’t normally attack yourself, but you might if you include yourself in a <a href="blast.md">blast</a>.</p>

<h3 id="threat">Threat</h3>

<p>The threat of the <a href="attack.md">attack</a> represents how difficult an attack is to avoid. Each attack lists it’s base threat, and you add your <a href="...html#abilities\agility">agility</a> to that threat do determine the total threat your target must contend with. You must take an attack’s threat as your choice of <a href="...html#combat\poise">poise</a>, <a href="...html#combat\momentum">momentum</a>, or <a href="...html#combat\focus">focus</a> damage if you want to avoid that attack’s <a href="...html#combat\yield">yield</a>, as detailed in the <a href="...html#combat\defending-vs-yielding">defending</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="yield">Yield</h3>

<p>An <a href="attack.md">attack’s</a> yield describes what the attack does if it is not <a href="...html#combat\defending-vs-yielding">defended</a> against. Each attack has a damage type (<a href="...html#combat\poise">poise</a>, <a href="...html#combat\momentum">momentum</a>, or <a href="...html#combat\focus">focus</a>) and damage dice that you roll if the target yields. Add together all the dice to determine the amount of damage you do with the attack. If it is a  <a href="melee.md">melee</a> attack, also add your  <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">brawn</a> to this damage. The target’s armor reduces the damage they take from an attack’s yield.</p>
