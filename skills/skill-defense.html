<h2 id="skill-defenses">Skill Defenses</h2>

<p>A skill may list a type of <a href="...html#combat\defenses">defense</a> that it grants or costs when used. A positive number grants you that of defense. If you can’t currently gain that type of defense, for example if you are <a href="...html#conditions\knocked-down">knocked-down</a> and trying to gain <a href="...html#combat\momentum">momentum</a>, then you may still use the skill but you gain no defense from it.
A negative number means that the skill costs defense, which you must pay before you can use the skill. This cost is unaffected by your <a href="...html#equipment\armor">armor</a>. If you can’t pay the cost, then you can’t use the skill. You may invoke a <a href="...html#combat\final-gambit">fina gambit</a> to use a skill without paying its defense cost, but doing so leaves you drained of energy and automatically <a href="...html#combat\defeated">defeated</a> afterwards.
A skill’s defense type also determines how it interacts with some conditions, like <a href="...html#conditions\kneeling">kneeling</a>, <a href="...html#conditions\distracted">distracted</a>, and <a href="...html#conditions\unbalanced">unbalanced</a>.</p>
