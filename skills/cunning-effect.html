<h2 id="cunning-effects">Cunning Effects</h2>

<p>For each of your skill’s dice that roll below your <a href="...html#abilities\cunning">cunning</a>, you have earned a cunning effect! The type of cunning effects you may add to the skill depend on the skill’s <a href="skill-tags.md">skill-tags</a>, and will usually offer you a choice. For example, a <a href="water.md">water</a> cunning effect can either make the target <a href="...html#conditions\wet">wet</a> or remove a <a href="...html#conditions">condition</a> from them. If your skill has multiple tags with cunning effects, you can choose any of those options, but only one effect per successful roll. You can also <a href="interrupt.md">interrupt</a> a character’s <a href="concentration.md">concentration</a> as a cunning effect.</p>

<p>If your skill earns three or more cunning effects, then each successful die after the second earns you a fated effect! Describe to the GM any outcome you can imagine your skill having, and the GM will tell you if it is reasonable, and what happens.</p>
