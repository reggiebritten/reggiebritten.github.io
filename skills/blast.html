<h3 id="blast">Blast</h3>

<p>A blast is a sphere that spreads out from the center a number of paces specified by the skill. For example, a two-pace blast would include the center of the area as well as anything within two paces of the center. The skill targets each character in the area, even yourself and characters that you can’t see. Blasts cannot normally go through walls, but can spread around them.</p>

<p>A blast can be <strong>central</strong>, <strong>point-blank</strong>, or <strong>within range</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A central blast means the area of the skill must be directly centered on you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A point-blank blast means that at least part of the area must be within one pace of you, but the area cannot include you. For example, a dragon’s fire breath is a point blank blast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A blast within range means that the center of the blast may be anywhere within the range of the skill. Note that the range applies to the center of the area, so it is possible for a character to be affected even beyond the listed range.</p>

</ul>
