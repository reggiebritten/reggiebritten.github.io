<h3 id="blast">Blast</h3>

<p>A blast is a sphere that spreads out from the center a number of spaces specified by the skill. For example, a two-space blast would include the center of the area as well as all spaces up to two spaces away from the center. The skill targets each character or space in the area, even yourself and characters that you canâ€™t see. Blasts cannot normally go through walls, but can spread around them.</p>

<p>A blast can be <strong>central</strong>, <strong>point-blank</strong>, or <strong>within range</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A central blast means the area of the skill must be directly centered on you. If you occupy more than one space, choose one of your spaces as the center of the blast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A point-blank blast means that at least one space of the blast must be adjacent to you, and no space can include you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A blast within range means that the center of the blast may be anywhere within the range of the skill. Note that the range applies to the center of the area, so it is possible for a character to be affected even beyond the listed range.</p>

</ul>
