<h3 id="banes">Banes</h3>

<p>Each bane that your <a href="skills.html">skill</a> suffers reduces the number of dice you roll for the skill by one. Each bane also reduces the skill’s <a href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> by +4 if it is an <a href="skills.html#attack">attack</a>. If the skill doesn’t roll dice and isn’t an attack, then it is not affected by banes. A skill’s dice can be reduced to 0, but not below 0. Even if an skill has 0 dice, any other effects still take place. Skills with multiple targets might suffer a bane against each target, or only some, depending on the source of the bane.</p>
