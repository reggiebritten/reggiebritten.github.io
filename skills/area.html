<h3 id="area">Area</h3>

<p>An area is a sphere that spreads out from the center a number of spaces specified by the skill. For example, a two-space radius area would include the center of the area as well as all spaces up to two spaces away from the center. Areas cannot normally go through walls, but can spread around them.</p>

<p>An area can be <strong>central</strong>, <strong>point-blank</strong>, or <strong>within range</strong>. A central area means the area of the skill must be directly centered on the character using it. A point-blank area means that at least one space of the area must be adjacent to the character using the skill, and no space can include the character. An area within range means that the center of the area may be anywhere within the range of the skill. Note that the range applies to the center of the area, so it is possible for a character to be affected even beyond the listed range.</p>
