<h3 id="immune">Immune</h3>

<p>If you are immune to a <a href="...html#conditions">condition</a>, then that condition can’t be applied to you. If you are immune to a specific tag, then the <a href="...html#combat\threat">threat</a> of any any <a href="attack.md">attack</a> with that tag is reduced to 0 against you, allowing you to ignore that attack if you choose. In addition, the GM is granted a point of <a href="...html#wip\game-running\doom">game-running/doom</a> when you attack an enemy with a tag to which they are immune. Note that a character only needs to be immune to one of a skill’s tags, not all of them.</p>
