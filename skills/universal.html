<h3 id="universal">Universal</h3>

<p>A universal skill is available to any character at any time, regardless of equipped weapons or fighting styles. You may still be prevented from using universal skills by other effects, such as the <a href="conditions.html#restrained">restrained</a> condition preventing you from dashing. The GM may rule that some universal skills are unavailable to certain characters, for example, a snake cannot reasonably use the kick skill.</p>
