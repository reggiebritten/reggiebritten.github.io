<h3 id="banes">Banes</h3>

<p>Each bane that your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skill</a> suffers reduces the number of dice you roll for the skill by one. Each bane also reduces the skill’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> by +4 if it is an <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a>. If the skill doesn’t roll dice and isn’t an attack, then it is not affected by banes. A skill’s dice can be reduced to 0, but not below 0. Even if an skill has 0 dice, any other effects still take place. If an effect gives your whole skill a bane, then it gains a bane against each target. However, other effects might only give your skill a bane against specific targets, not all of them.</p>
