<h3 id="attacks">Attacks</h3>

<p>An attack skill lets you wear down your target’s defenses and ultimately defeat them. In addition to the usual features of a skill, all attacks have a <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> and a <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a>, which the target must choose between. If an attack targets multiple different characters, then each may independently choose how to respond. See the <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defending</a> section for details on what to do when you are attacked. You can’t normally attack yourself, but you might if you include yourself in a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#blast">blast</a>.</p>

<h3 id="threat">Threat</h3>

<p>The threat of the <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> represents how difficult an attack is to avoid. Each attack lists it’s base threat, and you add your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a> to that threat do determine the total threat your target must contend with. You must take an attack’s threat as damage to your choice of <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> if you want to avoid that attack’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a>, as detailed in the <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defending</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="yield">Yield</h3>

<p>An <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack’s</a> yield describes what the attack does if it is not <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defended</a> against. Each attack has a damage type (<a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>) and damage dice that you roll if the target yields. Add together all the dice to determine the amount of damage you do with the attack. If it is a  <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#thrown">thrown</a> attack, also add your  <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> to this damage. The target’s armor reduces the damage they take from an attack’s yield.</p>

<p>Furthermore, compare each individual die to your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>. Each die that rolls equal to or below your cunning earns you a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#cunning-effects">cunning effect</a>, in addition to the yield’s other effects!</p>
