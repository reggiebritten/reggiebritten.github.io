<h2 id="action-challenges">Action Challenges</h2>

<p>A challenge is required every time a character uses a <a href="skills/utility.md">utility</a> <a href="skills/action.md">action</a> skill, or <a href="combat/yield.md">yields</a> to an <a href="skills/attack.md">attack</a> <a href="skills/action.md">action</a> skill. Challenges aren’t normally used for <a href="skills/maneuver.md">maneuvers</a>, <a href="skills/reaction.md">reactions</a>, or <a href="skills/passive.md">passive</a> skills.
The target number for an action challenge is 10, and the character using the skill further reduces the TN by their cunning. Other effects, such as boons and banes, can also modify a skill’s TN. Two ten-sided dice are rolled, however, the results of an action challenge are interpreted differently than a normal challenge.
If none of the dice beat the TN, then nothing happens; no additional complications arise. If exactly one of the dice beat the TN, then the action is a <a href="skills/cunning-effect.md">cunning-effect</a>! Critical actions grant bonus effects based on the type of skill used. If two or more dice beat the TN, then the action is fated! The character may choose two critical effects or invoke a free <a href="playing/twist-of-fate.md">twist of fate</a> related to the action. However, If all dice involved in an action challenge roll “1” or below, then the action is doomed and suffers a complication. If an action has multiple targets, a separate challenge should be rolled for each.</p>
<h3 id="cunning-effects">Cunning Effects</h3>

<p>For each of your skill’s dice that roll below your cunning, you have earned a cunning effect! Unlike an attack’s damage, a skill’s dice are not added together to determine cunning effects. Instead, each die is considered individually, and multiple dice below your cunning can earn multiple cunning effects. The type of cunning effects you may add to the skill depend on the skill’s tags, and will usually offer you a choice. For example, a <a href="skills/water.md">water</a> cunning effect can make the target <a href="conditions/wet.md">wet</a> or remove a condition from them.
If your skill earns three or more cunning effects, then it becomes fated instead! Describe to the GM any effect you can imagine your skill having, and the GM will tell you if it is reasonable, and what happens.</p>

<h3 id="boons">Boons</h3>

<p>Each boon that your <a href="skills/action.md">action</a> receives lets you roll one additional die for the action, and increases your action’s threat by +4 if it is an attack.</p>

<h3 id="banes">Banes</h3>

<p>Each bane that your <a href="skills/action.md">action</a> receives cancels out one <a href="skills/boon.md">boon</a> that the action has. Each excess bane removed one of the action’s dice, and reduces the <a href="combat/threat.md">threat</a> by -4 if it is an attack. An action’s dice can be reduced to 0, but not below 0. Even if an action has 0 dice, any other effects still take place.</p>
