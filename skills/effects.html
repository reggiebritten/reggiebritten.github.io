<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>

<p>A skill’s effects describe what it actually does when you use it. Most skills have effects, except for some straightforward attacks. Effects of a skill are not optional, they happen weather you want them to or not. However, some effects may offer you a choice. The effects of a skill always take place after pay or gaining the skill’s defense, but before any other outcomes are resolved.</p>

<h3 id="concentration">Concentration</h3>

<p>Some skills require your concentration to maintain their effects. While you’re concentrating on a skill, you may release your concentration any time on an ally’s turn, including your own, but not on an enemy’s.</p>

<p>Concentrating on a skill doesn’t come with any inherent cost or penalty. However, you can only concentrate on one skill at a time. If you use a second concentration skill while you are already concentrating on another one, then you must either release your concentration on the first skill or ignore the concentration effects of the second skill.</p>

<h3 id="interrupting-concentration">Interrupting Concentration</h3>

<p>Some effects will let you interrupt a character who is concentrating on a skill. In particular, interrupting your target’s concentration is always an option for a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#cunning-effects">cunning-effect</a>. When you interrupt a character, any effects they were concentrating on immediately end. Some concentration effects are automatically interrupted when specific events come to pass, and some skills might do something special when they are interrupted.</p>
