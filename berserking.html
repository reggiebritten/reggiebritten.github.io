<h3 id="berserking">Berserking</h3>
<p>While others might fear the chaos of battle, you thrive in it! Whenever you are <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a>, you are also <strong>berserking</strong>! While you’re berserking, being confused doesn’t suppress your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and whenever you would gain <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>, you gain an equal amount of <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> instead. However, your attacks must still always target a random character within range; position yourself carefully to avoid accidentally attacking your allies!</p>

<p>You must equip at least four berserk skills to your fighting style as <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#bonus">bonus</a> skills, and you can equip as many more as you like. When you first become berserking, you gain access to one randomly selected berserk skill you have equipped. At the end of each of your turns while you are berserking, randomly select a berserking skill to gain access to. As soon as you are no longer confused, you stop berserking and loose access to your berserk skills.</p>
