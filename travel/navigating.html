<h3 id="navigating">Navigating</h3>

<p>You keep careful watch of landmarks, your navigational tools, and the stars at night to make sure your group doesn’t get lost. The GM will call for a <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>ruggedness</strong>, but the GM will usually make this roll in secret. Tracking a creature or group is also considered navigating, and the GM will set the difficulty based on the landscape and your quarry. Success means you stay on course, while failure means you get lost. The GM will only describe what you see, hear, and know, so you must pay attention for signs that you might have gotten lost. Your group can only benefit from one successful navigator per day, though you can attempt a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#group-rolls">group roll</a> if you wish.</p>
