<h2 id="travel-activities">Travel Activities</h2>

<p>While traveling, you can undertake additional activities that help you on your adventure. At the start of each day of travel, tell the GM which, if any, activity you will do while you travel. In particular, you should make sure you have a navigator unless you can follow clear landmarks like roads or rivers.</p>

<p>With the exception of navigators and trailblazers, your group can benefit from multiple characters participating in the same activity. Travel activities can adjust your speed, <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>, and <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#supplies">supplies</a> favorably or unfavorably depending on your success. So consider your priorities, strengths, and the landscape when deciding the best course of action. You are encouraged to use your <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#background">background</a>, any tools you have, and what you know about the terrain to aid with your travel activities.</p>

<p>Your activities will also determine your positions if a fight breaks out. Trailblazers and scouts will generally lead the way, with navigators close behind. Hunters and foragers will generally be to the side and a little off the beaten path looking for resources. Haulers, provisioners, and entertainers will generally be in the back taking care of supplies and allies.</p>

<h3 id="navigating">Navigating</h3>

<p>You keep careful watch of landmarks, your navigational tools, and the stars at night to make sure your group doesn’t get lost. The GM will call for a <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>ruggedness</strong>, but the GM will usually make this roll in secret. Tracking a creature or group is also considered navigating, and the GM will set the difficulty based on the landscape and your quarry. Success means you stay on course, while failure means you get lost. The GM will only describe what you see, hear, and know, so you must pay attention for signs that you might have gotten lost. Your group can only benefit from one successful navigator per day, though you can attempt a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#group-rolls">group roll</a> if you wish.</p>

<h3 id="foraging">Foraging</h3>

<p>You rummage and dig to find valuable plants and minerals, especially water if you are in an arid environment. Make a <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>fertility</strong>. You gain one <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#supplies">supply</a> for each of your successful dice and find water if at least one die is successful. Failure means you attract unwanted attention and generate a point of <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>, although a successful scout can prevent this point of doom. A mixed roll results in both.</p>

<h3 id="scouting">Scouting</h3>

<p>You keep a watchful eye out for danger and make sure that your group doesn’t stumble into dangerous situations. Make an <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>ruggedness</strong>. Success reduces the amount of <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a> your group generates by one. Failure means you end up slowing your group’s travel speed by 5 mi / 8 km for the day as they wait for you. A mixed roll results in both.</p>

<h3 id="hunting">Hunting</h3>

<p>You creep through the wilderness to hunt animals for their meat and other useful materials. Make an <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>fertility</strong>. You gain one <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#supplies">supply</a> for each of your successful dice. Failure means you attract unwanted attention and generate a point of <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>, although a successful scout can prevent this point of doom. A mixed roll results in both. <br />
A ranged weapon, such as a bow, is a minimum requirement for hunting. Most weapons don’t offer any bonus to your hunting roll, although specialized hunting tools might.</p>

<h3 id="trailblazing">Trailblazing</h3>

<p>You clear your path of underbrush, vines, or rocks and hike hills and climb trees make sure your group finds the easiest path forward. Make a <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>ruggedness</strong>. Success means you increase your group’s travel speed by 5 mi / 8 km for the day. Failure means you overexert yourself and suffer a point of <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>. A mixed roll results in both. Your group can only benefit from one successful trailblazer per day, though you can attempt a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#group-rolls">group roll</a> if you wish.</p>

<h3 id="hauling">Hauling</h3>

<p>You offer to aid your allies by carrying some of their gear and handling the lion’s share of the manual labor. Make a <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>ruggedness</strong>. Success lets you relive one stress each from two of your traveling companions. Failure means you end up slowing your group’s travel speed by 5 mi / 8 km for the day. A mixed roll results in both.</p>

<h3 id="provisioning">Provisioning</h3>

<p>You tend to your group’s supplies to prevent spoilage and waste, and craft what you can to replenish supplies. Make a <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#serious-vs-whimsical">serious</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>fertility</strong>. Success lets you choose two of your traveling companions to not expend <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#supplies">supplies</a> for the day. Failure means your strict provisioning has cause one of your traveling companions one <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>. A mixed roll results in both.</p>

<h3 id="entertaining">Entertaining</h3>

<p>You tell stories, play music, and crack jokes to lighten the spirits of your companions. Make a <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#serious-vs-whimsical">whimsical</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>ruggedness</strong>. Success lets you relive one stress each from two of your traveling companions. Failure means you attract unwanted attention and generate a point of <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>, although a successful scout can prevent this point of doom.

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>You might also set your own priorities when you travel. You might choose to create a map, mitigate a specific environmental hazard, cover your tracks so you can’t be followed. Tell the GM what you’d like to do during the day, and the GM will tell you what rules to use.</p>

<h3 id="forced-march">Forced March</h3>

<p>In addition to other travel activities, you can push yourself to travel faster, at the cost of suffering <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>. You may travel an additional 5 mi / 8 km per day at the cost of one stress, or an additional 10 mi / 16 km per day at the cost of three stress. You can benefit from a forced march even while doing other activities, and you don’t need to roll. But everyone in you group must choose a forced march or else you become separated from those who don’t.</p>
