<p>You creep through the wilderness to hunt animals for their meat and other useful materials. Make an <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>fertility</strong>. You gain one <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#supplies">supply</a> for each of your successful dice. Failure means you attract unwanted attention and generate a point of <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>, although a successful scout can prevent this point of doom. A mixed roll results in both. <br />
A ranged weapon, such as a bow, is a minimum requirement for hunting. Most weapons don’t offer any bonus to your hunting roll, although specialized hunting tools might.</p>
