<h3 id="forced-march">Forced March</h3>

<p>In addition to other travel activities, you can push yourself to travel faster, at the cost of suffering <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>. You may travel an additional 5 mi / 8 km per day at the cost of one stress, or an additional 10 mi / 16 km per day at the cost of three stress. You can benefit from a forced march even while doing other activities, and you don’t need to roll. But everyone in you group must choose a forced march or else you become separated from those who don’t.</p>
