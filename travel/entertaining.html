<p>You tell stories, play music, and crack jokes to lighten the spirits of your companions. Make a <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#serious-vs-whimsical">whimsical</a> <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a> based on the landscape’s <strong>ruggedness</strong>. Success lets you relive one stress each from two of your traveling companions. Failure means you attract unwanted attention and generate a point of <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#doom">doom</a>, although a successful scout can prevent this point of doom. A mixed roll results in both.</p>
