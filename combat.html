<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>

<p><em>*Each strike you make must truly be two at once. One strike that will force your opponent off-guard if they react to it, and one strike that will slay them if they do not. Victory, then, is giving your foe no choice but defeat.</em>
-Anonymous Swordmaster</p>

<p>When alternatives fail and foes won’t listen to reason, heroes must turn to combat to see that justice is served. In combat, characters take turns using abilities to traverse the battlefield, attack enemies, and support allies.</p>

<p>Movement abilities let character get into or out of the action or surround an enemy for a decisive attack. Attacks will reduce the vigor of the target and may eventually lead to the character’s defeat, although one defeat often isn’t the end of a hero’s story. Fated actions can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but doomed actions can ruin any carefully constructed plan.</p>

<h2 id="turns--rounds">Turns &amp; Rounds</h2>

<p>Combat begins as soon as one character does something that other characters witness and are willing and able to oppose. That first acting character takes the first turn of combat. Any other characters may use a reaction to immediately draw any weapons they have equipped.</p>

<p>A character may use two abilities on their turn, one action and one maneuver. Actions typically involve attacking enemies or supporting allies, while maneuvers typically involve moving to a better location or preparing for another ability. A character may also use reactions on their own turn, as well as during other characters’ turns.</p>

<p>Once a character has finished their turn, an enemy character takes a turn. Typically, combat will occur between the group player characters and one group of NPCs controlled by the GM. When an enemy NPC finishes a turn, the players will collaborate to choose one of their characters who has not yet acted to take the next turn. When a player character finishes their turn, the GM will choose one NPC combatant who has not taken a turn to take the next turn. This cycle continues until all characters have taken their turns.</p>

<p>If all characters on one side have taken their turns, and other characters on the enemy side have not, then the first side must pass the turn until all characters on the opposite side have taken a turn. Once the last character in the combat has taken their turn, the round ends and the opposing side takes the first turn next round.</p>

<p>Some effects, especially environmental effects, do something at the end of the round. Once all characters have taken their turns, these effects should be resolved before the next round begins.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="advanced-turn-rules">Advanced Turn Rules</h3>

  <p>The above rules cover the majority of combat situations,    but these rules clarify how turns work in more unusual circumstances.    If one side of the combatants includes both players and    NPCs, the players should decide when the NPCs on their side take their    turns as if they were also player characters. If a combat includes three or    more groups with mutually competing goals, the GM may decide to form three    or more sides taking turns in order.    Some powerful creatures, especially legendary foes,    may take multiple turns in a single round. If they fight alongside lesser    minions, then they may choose to take their turns back to back after the    players’ near the start of the round, or let their minions act first and    use their multiple turns in succession toward then end of the round.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="vigor">Vigor</h2>

<p>The most common goal of combat is to defeat one’s enemies, and that is accomplished by reducing an enemy’s vigor to zero. Vigor describes a character’s ability to continue fighting and defending themself. For player characters and many elite enemies, vigor is the combination of the character’s                                   poise,   momentum, and   focus.</p>

<p>​      Poise   describes a character’s precise balance and control of their weapons and fighting stance. Abilities that spend poise require precise coordination, while abilities that gain poise let the character readjust their balance. Taking poise damage means being knocked off balance or being forced into an awkward position, and fighting atop a swaying bridge might cause a character to lose poise.</p>

<p>Momentum   describes how much physical force a character can put into their motions. An ability that slams down into the ground might cost momentum, while an ability that lets a character surge forward might grant momentum. Effects that slam, push, or buffet a character, like a mace blow or howling winds, might damage or reduce a character’s momentum.</p>

<p>Focus   represents a character’s awareness of themselves, other character in the battle, and the battlefield itself. Abilities that require intense attention will cost focus, but abilities that gain focus only take a fleeting thought. Anything that draws a character’s attention away from the battle will deplete their focus, including an enemy’s volley or a booming explosion.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, a character begins combat at their base poise, momentum, and focus. A character’s base poise is equal to four plus four times their agility, their base momentum is equal to four plus four times their brawn, and their base focus is equal to four plus four times their cunning.</p>

<p>Many abilities allow characters to gain vigor, and a character may gain vigor above their base value. However, practically all of these are noisy, obvious, and threatening to any enemies nearby. Even in the absence of apparent enemies, the GM may add doom to the pool if players dally to gain vigor in dangerous territory. When the adrenaline of combat fades, typically after about a minute, the characters’ poise momentum and focus return to their base values.</p>

<p>Some characters, especially weaker NPCs, do not have poise, momentum, or focus. Instead, they simply have vigor, which represents all three together. Whenever such an NPC would gain or lose poise, momentum or focus, their vigor is adjusted by that amount instead.</p>

<p>When a character’s poise, momentum, or focus are reduced to zero, typically by enemy attacks, they begin to suffer major setbacks. When a character’s poise is reduced to zero, they become disarmed. If one’s momentum is reduced to zero, they become knocked-down. And if a character’s focus is reduced to zero, they become confused, as explained in the Running out of Vigor section below.</p>

<p>Armor can reduce the damage taken by characters, but it does not reduce the cost the character must pay to use an ability or any effects that say a character loses or must pay vigor.</p>

<h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>

<p>Abilities are specific things a character can do to help achieve their goals. Some abilities have useful effects outside of combat, but most abilities help to defeat a character’s enemies and protect their allies.</p>

<p>Each ability may have a positive or negative vigor number that represents how much exertion the character must spend. Powerful abilities will have a cost that the character must pay in poise, momentum, or focus (specified by the ability). Weaker abilities allow the character the chance to gain poise, momentum, or focus.</p>

<p>An ability with a cost cannot be used if the character doesn’t have enough of the specified vigor remaining. Some effects will prevent a character from gaining vigor. In that case, an ability that lets a character gain vigor can still be used, but the character doesn’t gain the associated vigor.</p>

<p>Abilities also have effects, which describe what the ability does when used. Each ability has specific effects which may come with unique rules. Most effects of an ability happen whether the character wants them to or not; in general, the effects of an ability are not optional. However, some ability effects will specify that a character gets a choice or may or may not use a certain effect. Some peculiar ability effects may be unclear in unusual circumstances. If so, the GM may determine what happens.</p>

<p>Many abilities, especially reactions, have a requirement that must be met for the ability to be used. Abilities can also have tags, special target rules and concentration effects, and attacks have a threat and a yield. These concepts are explained in detail below.</p>

<p>All abilities are assumed to make a significant amount of noise, whether it’s the clatter of footfalls, grunts of exertion, the clang of steel on steel, the thrum of a bowstring, or arcane words of power. The exception to this rule is an ability that has the stealthy tag, which can be used without making a commotion.</p>

<h3 id="ability-types">Ability Types</h3>

<p>Each ability has a type that describes how it is used in combat. There are four types of abilities: Actions, Maneuvers, Reactions, &amp; Passives.</p>

<p>Actions are usually the most powerful abilities, but each character may only use one action on their turn. Most attacks are actions. Characters may add their agility, might, and/or cunning to their actions depending on the action’s tags. The fate dice are often rolled alongside actions, and they can become fated or doomed, as detailed below.</p>

<p>Maneuvers are typically less impactful than actions. each character may only use one maneuver each turn. The most common is the dash maneuver, which lets a character move up to 3 spaces plus their speed. Using a maneuver in an enemy’s zone of control is risky, as described below.</p>

<p>A character can give up their action to use a second maneuver in a turn, but if they do, they lose their zone of control (described below) until the start of their next turn.</p>

<p>A character cannot use an action in the middle of a maneuver, or vice-versa.</p>

<p>Reactions may be used at any time, even during another character’s turn and during an ability. However, all reactions have a requirement, which must be met before the reaction can be used. A character can use reactions as often as their requirements are met, but normally only once per requiring event.</p>

<p>Passive abilities are always in effect, and do not require anything for a character to receive their benefits.</p>

<h3 id="ability-targets">Ability Targets</h3>

<p>Like the above ability types, most abilities also have a target. An ability’s target describes which characters or spaces the ability affects. Passive abilities don’t usually have targets. Except for areas, lines, and personal abilities, the user must be able to see the target.</p>

<p>All abilities except passives are either personal, melee, or ranged. A personal ability can only affect the character using it. A melee ability can affect a character who is within one space of the character using the ability. Ranged abilities may be short-ranged, which can target a character within 5 spaces, medium-ranged, which can target a character within 10 spaces, or long-ranged, which can target a character within 20 spaces. Other abilities may simply be ranged, with a more specific target specified by the ability.</p>

<p>Most melee and ranged abilities are either support abilities or attacks. Support abilities are almost always beneficial effects for the target. However, they only affect willing characters; a support ability that targets an unwilling character is ineffective. A character can target themself with a support ability, but not an attack ability.</p>

<p>Attacks follow the rules for Attack &amp; Defense, detailed below. Most attacks are standard attacks, which mean they target only one character within the attack’s range. An attack that isn’t standard has special target rules. Those should be decided when the attack is initiated, and each character targeted by the attack must choose to mitigate or yield the attack on their own.</p>

<p>Some abilities also specify that they target an area or a line. A line always specifies a range and begins from the character using the ability. The character may draw a line in any direction, and the ability targets any space that the line passes though up to the maximum range.</p>

<p>An area is a sphere that spreads out from the center a number of spaces specified by the ability. For example, a two-space wide area would include the center of the area as well as all spaces up to two spaces away from the center. Unless specified otherwise, areas cannot go through walls, but can spread around them.</p>

<p>An area can be central, point-blank, or within range. A central area means the area of the ability must be directly centered on the character using it. A point-blank area means that at least one space of the area must be adjacent to the character using the ability, and no space can include the character. An area within range means that the center of the area may be anywhere within the range of the ability.</p>

<h3 id="ability-tags">Ability Tags</h3>

<p>All abilities have tags, which describe how the ability interacts with other parts of the game. Ability tags include the above ability types and targets, such as action, medium-ranged, and support, but there are many other ability tags as well.</p>

<p>An ability’s source is also a type of tag, such as the weapon tag for all abilities that come from weapons, the universal tag for abilities that characters always have access to, or a specific class.</p>

<p>Some tags have specific rules that apply to the tag. For example, if an ability has the melee, attack, and action tags, then the attacker should add their momentum to the damage of the attack’s yield. Ability tags with specific rules not yet mentioned are described below. A list of all ability tags alongside all rules can be found in the Glossary of Tags chapter below.</p>

<p>Other tags don’t have any rules on their own, but may become relevant depending on the circumstance. For example, if an attack has then fire tag, then it gains a boon against any target with fire vulnerability, but a bane against any target with fire resistance.</p>

<p>Tags also determine what kind of fated effects or doomed effects, an ability can have, as described in the Fated &amp; Doomed Actions section below.</p>

<h3 id="other-ability-tag-rules">Other Ability Tag Rules</h3>

<p>Attack: the ability is used to attack an enemy and follows the rules for attacking outlined below.</p>

<p>Support: The ability is used to help yourself or an ally, it is ineffective on any unwilling character.</p>

<p>Movement: You must be able to move at least 1 space to use the ability, if you are grabbed, restrained, knocked-down, or otherwise can’t move, the ability is ineffective.</p>

<p>Stealthy: The ability is relatively inconspicuous. You can try to use it while remaining hidden, although that will often require an agility roll.</p>

<p>Unarmed: You must have at least one empty hand to use the ability.</p>

<p>Careful: Although this ability is a maneuver, it cannot be hindered.</p>

<p>Reckless: This ability can be hindered even though it is not a maneuver.</p>

<p>Push: The ability pushes the target. A character pushed into another character or an impassable obstacle takes -2   momentum damage for each space it would have been pushed.</p>

<p>Unblockable: the target of an unblockable attack can’t use momentum to mitigate the attack.</p>

<p>Undodgeable: the target of an undodgeable attack can’t use poise to mitigate the attack.</p>

<p>Unpredictable: the target of an unpredictable attack can’t use focus to mitigate the attack.</p>

<p>ZoC: A weapon with the ZoC tag gives the character a zone of control while wielded. Unless specified otherwise, the zone of control includes their space and all adjacent spaces.</p>

<p>Reloading: After you make a ranged attack with a reloading weapon, it becomes unloaded. An unloaded weapon can’t be used to make ranged attacks until a reloading ability has been used to reload it, although it can still be used for any ability that isn’t a ranged attack. A reloading ability reloads the weapon, so it may make ranged attacks again.</p>

<p>All reloading weapons come with the basic reload ability, but prepared characters can reload more skillfully. While you have a reloading weapon equipped in your fighting style, you may equip a reloading special ability as an extra ability that doesn’t count against the usual limit.</p>

<h2 id="universal-abilities">Universal Abilities</h2>

<p>Some universal abilities are available to all characters regardless of fighting style or weapons equipped. These include moving around, attacking without a weapon, and recovering vigor. All universal abilities are described here.</p>

<p>Crawl</p>

<p>⌛ Maneuver 🎯 Personal 🏷️ Movement 🗝️ Universal</p>

<p>Effect: Move two spaces. You can use this maneuver even while you are knocked-down or defeated.</p>

<h2 id="movement--position">Movement &amp; Position</h2>

<p>Moving around the battlefield is the surest way to gain the (sometimes literal) upper hand on your enemies and ensure you are positioned where you’re most effective. Movement is counted in spaces, where one space is equivalent to about 5 feet or 1½ meters.</p>

<p>The most reliable way to get from place to place is the dash maneuver, which allows a character to move 3 spaces plus their speed. However, using most maneuvers, like dash, in an enemy’s zone of control carries a risk of being hindered as described below. Another movement option available to character is the step maneuver, which lets a character move 1 space. Since it has the careful tag, it can ’t be hindered. Finally, the sprint reaction lets a character trade momentum for a burst of speed.</p>

<p>Whenever a character moves, there are a few rules that must be followed. A character can move freely through another friendly character’s space, but not an enemy’s. A character can’t end their turn in another character’s space; if two characters somehow find themselves in the same space at the end of a turn, the GM will push one of them into an adjacent space.</p>

<p>A character moving diagonally pays one space of movement the first time they move diagonally on a turn, then two spaces for the next time they move diagonally, repeating that pattern as they continue to move diagonally. A character can’t move diagonally if the movement would cut through an impassable obstacle or a hostile character’s space.</p>

<p>A character can use three spaces of movement to do other things relating to movement, like opening or closing a door or mounting a horse, or becoming kneeling. A character swimming, climbing, or moving into shattered terrain or overgrown terrain must spend two movement points to move one space.</p>

<p>Some effects make a character move half the usual distance. That means that a character should add together any movement and speed from the ability they are using, divide that in half, and round down, possibly not moving at all. Other effects may reduce a character’s speed to zero. Such a character still benefits from moving spaces specified by an ability, but never adds their speed to the total distance moved.</p>

<p>Some abilities will push a character in a specific direction. These abilities can’t push a character into a space occupied by another character or an obstacle. Instead, a character pushed into an occupied space takes -2   momentum damage per space they would have been pushed.</p>

<p>If a character is pushed from a tall height like a building or a cliff, they may choose to become knocked-down and dangling from the ledge rather than falling. A character dangling from a ledge can’t mitigate attacks and suffers a bane on brawn talent rolls trying to climb back up. If a character is already knocked-down or dangling when they’re pushed from a height, they have no choice but to fall.</p>

<h3 id="optional----rule-----pushing-and-size-difference-----if-your-group-uses-this-rule-it-can-be-easy-for-larger----characters-to-push-around-smaller-ones-and-harder-for-small-character-to----push-bigger-ones-whenever-one-character-pushes-another-the-distance----pushed-is-increased-by-1-for-every-size-larger-the-pushing-character-is----but-decreased-by-1-for-every-size-smaller-the-pushing-character-is----------------------zone-of-control">Optional    Rule:     Pushing and size difference     If your group uses this rule, it can be easy for larger    characters to push around smaller ones, and harder for small character to    push bigger ones. Whenever one character pushes another, the distance    pushed is increased by 1 for every size larger the pushing character is,    but decreased by 1 for every size smaller the pushing character is.                      Zone of Control</h3>

<p>​</p>

<p>​        Optional Rule:    Back to back fighting    Fighting back to back with an ally can give both of you    the chance to coordinate the perfect strike or foil your foe’s attacks with    a combined defense. If your group chooses to use this rule, then whenever    you begin your turn adjacent to at least one ally, you gain +2           poise.</p>

<p>A character’s zone of control is the area of the battlefield where they can interfere with an enemy’s movements and exploit an enemy who drops their guard. A character armed with a ZoC weapon, typically a weapon used for melee combat, has a zone of control that includes their own space and all spaces adjacent to them. A character who isn’t armed with a ZoC weapon doesn’t normally have a zone of control. A character has no zone of control if they are knocked-down, disarmed, confused, or affected by certain other conditions.</p>

<p>A character’s zone of control determines where they can hinder maneuvers and when they have an enemy surrounded. A character that uses a ranged action while in an enemy’s zone of control adds a bane to the ability.</p>

<h3 id="hindering-maneuvers">Hindering Maneuvers</h3>

<p>Using most maneuvers while engaged in melee combat is risky. While a character is using any maneuver in a hostile character’s zone of control, the hostile character can use a reaction to hinder the maneuvering character.</p>

<p>When a character is hindered, they immediately lose -2   poise, -2   momentum, and -2   focus. Hindering is not an attack; no dice should be rolled, no talent bonuses added, and the hindered character doesn’t benefit from armor. A character may enter a hostile character’s zone of control without being hindered, but moving from within an enemy zone of control allows that enemy to hinder the character.</p>

<p>However much distance a character moves or however many maneuvers they use, a character can only be hindered by each enemy once on a turn. However, a character may be hindered by many enemies if they use a maneuver in multiple enemies’ zones of control.</p>

<p>There are two exceptions to when an ability can be hindered, the careful and reckless tags. A maneuver with the careful tag may not be hindered, while any ability with the reckless tag may be interrupted, even if it is not a maneuver.</p>

<h3 id="surrounding">Surrounding</h3>

<p>A character may become surrounded if they have multiple enemies or obstacles closing off their retreat. In simple terms, a character is surrounded if they can’t leave an enemy’s zone of control. More precisely, a character is surrounded if they are within the zone of control of one or more enemies, and every adjacent space into which they could move is also within the zone of control of at least one of those enemies. A character is also surrounded if they have two enemies with active zones of control on directly opposite corners. Attack actions against a surrounded character gain a boon.</p>

<p>​   <br />
 Even if a character can’t move, or could teleport, the adjacent spaces into which they could hypothetically move should be considered. If an obstacle prevents movement into a space, that space doesn’t need to be in an enemy’s zone of control for a character to be surrounded. A character is not surrounded as long as they could leave the zones of control they are currently in, even if it means moving into someone else’s zone of control. Since characters can move into the space of a friendly character, a space occupied by a friendly character doesn’t count against a character to determine if they are surrounded unless it is also in an enemy’s zone of control.</p>

<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<p>A character’s size describes how big they are and how much space they take up. A normal human’s size is one. A creature with a size larger than one takes up a square with each side made of spaces equal to their size, so a size three character takes up a three by three square, or nine spaces in total.</p>

<p>Smaller character are described as fractions, such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and so on. Such creatures normally still take up one entire space. Different sizes don’t come with any inherent bonuses or penalties, but may become relevant for certain abilities or grabbing.</p>

<h3 id="optional-rule----advanced-high-ground----holding-the-high-ground-can-be-a-tremendous-advantage----and-taking-or-relinquishing-the-high-ground-can-be-a-major-decision-if-your----group-decides-to-use-these-rules----moving-up-by-one-space-either-costs--2-----------momentum-per----space-ascended-or-twice-as-many-movement-points-however-descending-by-a----space-grants-2-----------momentum-per----space-descended-a-gradual-slope-may-require-moving-laterally-several----spaces-to-ascend-or-descend-one-space----a-ranged-attack-fired-from-higher-ground-that-the-target----adds-the-height-difference-to-the-range-of-the-attack-a-ranged-attack-from----lower-ground-subtracts-the-height-difference-from-the-range-----------------cover--highground">Optional Rule:    Advanced high ground    Holding the high ground can be a tremendous advantage,    and taking or relinquishing the high ground can be a major decision if your    group decides to use these rules.    Moving up by one space either costs -2           momentum per    space ascended or twice as many movement points. However, descending by a    space grants +2           momentum per    space descended. A gradual slope may require moving laterally several    spaces to ascend or descend one space.    A ranged attack fired from higher ground that the target    adds the height difference to the range of the attack. A ranged attack from    lower ground subtracts the height difference from the range.                 Cover &amp; Highground</h3>

<p>A character might have cover against an ability if an obstacle or another character partially blocks their line of sight. Attacks, support actions, ranged actions, and melee actions might all be penalized by cover if something is in the way.</p>

<p>​      Specifically, any action that passes through a space containing an obstacle or another character suffers a bane. The obstacle might be a tree, a corner, a low wall, or anything else that would partially block the view of the target. Remember that an ability can’t normally even target a character that the user can’t see at all.</p>

<p>If the situation allows it, a character can pop out from behind cover, attack, then duck back into cover all on their turn. However, if a character must move by at least one space to emerge from cover, such as running around a corner, they probably won’t be able to move back into their old space on the same turn.</p>

<p>If you are standing on higher ground than your target (typically by at least 3 feet / 1 meter, but up to GM discretion) when you target them with a melee attack action, then the attack gains a boon. However, if such an attack is made from lower ground than the target, it suffers a bane.</p>

<p>##</p>

<h2 id="concentration">Concentration</h2>

<p>Some abilities require the user’s active concentration. This means that the ability requires the character who used it to focus on maintaining one or more of the effects.</p>

<p>Unlike most other effects of an ability, concentration effects may be ignored by the character using the ability if desired. While a character is concentrating on an effect, they may release their concentration any time on a friendly character’s turn, but not on an enemy’s turn.</p>

<p>Concentrating on an ability doesn’t come with any inherent cost or penalty, however it does have a few conditions. For one, a character may only concentrate on one ability at a time. If a character uses a second concentration ability while they are already concentrating on another one, then they must either release concentration on the first ability or ignore the concentration effects of the second ability.</p>

<p>A character’s concentration may be interrupted because of an ability effect or a fated effect, which means the concentration immediately ends. Many concentration effects also have interrupted effects, which specifies either a circumstance that will interrupt the character’s concentration if it comes to pass, something special that happens when the character’s concentration is interrupted, or both. However, the interrupted effects don’t come into effect if the character willing releases their concentration.</p>

<h2 id="attack--defense">Attack &amp; Defense</h2>

<p>An attack is a hostile ability that attempts to reduce the target’s vigor and apply other effects, especially negative conditions. Attacks have effects, vigor costs or gains, and tags like other abilities. Additionally, all attacks give the defender a choice between the threat of the attack or that attack’s yield.</p>

<p>The threat of the attack represents how difficult an attack is to avoid. Each attack has a number that represents its threat, and a character should add their agility to the threat of any attack they use with the weapon and action tags.</p>

<p>An attack’s yield describes what the attack does if it is not mitigated. Almost all attacks will deal damage to poise, momentum, or focus, along with some additional effect specified by the ability. If the attack is a melee action, then the attacker adds their brawn as damage to the attack’s yield.</p>

<p>When a character is targeted by an attack, they are given a choice between mitigating the attack or yielding the attack. Mitigating the attack means directly applying the threat of the attack as damage to the defender’s choice of poise, momentum, or focus.</p>

<p>Mitigating an attack is often more costly than yielding, but it is more reliable, and the defender has more choice in which kind of vigor is damaged. Mitigating with poise is called dodging, mitigating with momentum is called blocking, and mitigating with focus is called predicting.</p>

<p>In contrast, yielding an attack means accepting the yield of the attack. An attack’s yield often does a random amount of damage to a specific kind of vigor (specified by the attack) along with other negative consequences.</p>

<p>Effects of the attack take place regardless of any other decisions of the attacker or the defender. Whether the attack is mitigated or yielded, the effects are usually resolved first (though still after the user spends or gains vigor). If the attack is a ranged action, then the attacker gains focus equal to their cunning as an effect of the attack.</p>

<p>Yielding to an attack also means rolling the fate die, which can result in the attack becoming fated or a doomed, as described below.</p>

<p>Some attacks may deal damage to multiple vigor types or from multiple sources, including fated effects, or being pushed into obstacles. In that case, the defender’s armor should only be applied once to the total damage dealt, not each instance of damage. However, the defender may choose which vigor damage their armor prevents. Remember that armor only prevents damage, not other kinds of vigor loss.</p>

<p>If an attack reduces a character poise momentum or focus to zero, excess damage carries over into another vigor of the defender’s choice. If all three pools are reduced to zero, that character is defeated and excess damage carries over to the character’s stress.</p>

<h3 id="order-of-resolution">Order of Resolution</h3>

<p>Some abilities, attack, support or otherwise, will offer the user, the target, or both a choice about what happens. Unless specified otherwise, an ability’s effects require the character using it to choose first before anything else happens and before the target decides to yield or mitigate an attack.</p>

<p>However, an attack’s yield requires the target to choose first, then the attacker may choose any additional effects afterwards.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, the ability user makes a choice offered by the ability effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, characters may choose to intervene with reactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the target chooses from the choices offered, including mitigating or yielding an attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourth, reactions may be used again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the user chooses frothe options of the yield, and any fated effects.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="boons-and-banes">Boons and Banes</h3>

<p>Boons and banes work slightly differently for attacks than for talent and influence rolls. Boons and banes also apply to support actions, as described in the Fated &amp; Doomed Actions section below.</p>

<p>For each boon an attack has, the threat of the attack is increased by +2. If the target yields to an attack action, then the attacker rolls an additional fate die for each boon. Any fate dice that roll above the attacker’s fated action threshold add a fated effect. One attack can result in many fated effects, and the attacker can choose the same fated effect multiple times. An attack with boons is only doomed if all the fate dice roll 1.</p>

<p>Each bane subtracts -2 from the threat of the attack. If the target yields to an attack action, then the attacker must roll an additional fate die for each bane. Any fate dice that roll a 1 result in a doomed effect, and the attack is only fated if all the fate die roll above the attacker’s fated action threshold. Boons and banes cancel each other out as normal.</p>

<p>Remember that boons and banes, as well as the fate dice, only apply to actions. Attacks or abilities that aren’t actions don’t have their threat modified by boons and banes and don’t roll any fate dice.</p>

<h3 id="vulnerabile-resistant-immune--ineffective">Vulnerabile, Resistant, Immune, &amp; Ineffective</h3>

<p>Some characters may be vulnerable, resistant, or immune to certain ability tags, and certain circumstances may render an ability ineffective. Characters may also be immune to specific conditions.</p>

<p>If a character is vulnerable to an ability tag, then attack actions with that tag gain a boon against the character. However, if a character is resistant to an ability tag, then attack actions with the tag suffer a bane. A character who is immune to one of an ability’s tags may choose to ignore any effects, threat, or yield. If an ability is ineffective, then the character must ignore the effects, threat and yield, whether they want to or not.</p>

<p>A character only needs to be vulnerable, resistant, immune, or unaffected to one of an ability’s tags for the bonus or penalty to apply. If a character is resistant to one tag of an ability but vulnerable to another tag of the ability, then both a boon and a bane are added, which cancel out. If a character is vulnerable to one tag but immune to another, then they are still immune to the ability. If a character is vulnerable or resistant to the same tag from multiple sources, they still only add one boon or bane.</p>

<p>A character who is immune to a specific condition may still be affected by abilities that inflict that condition, but the condition itself can’t be applied to the character.</p>

<h2 id="fated--doomed-actions">Fated &amp; Doomed Actions</h2>

<p>After a character yields to an attack action (but not attacks that aren’t actions) or uses a support action, the fate dice are rolled. If any roll above the character’s fated action threshold (10 minus the character’s cunning), then the ability has become fated! However, if the fate die rolls a ‘1’, then the ability is doomed!</p>

<p>Some conditions or abilities may modify a character’s fated action threshold. However, a fated action threshold can never be reduced below two; rolling a 1 is always doomed.</p>

<p>Even if an ability targets multiple characters, fate dice should only be rolled once to determine if the whole action is fated or doomed. Only one creature may be affected by each fated effect; a fated effect doesn’t apply to all targets. However, if there multiple fated effects are rolled, a different one may be applied to each target.</p>

<p>A fated action gives the character using it a choice. The character may choose to invoke a discounted twist of fate related to the ability as normal, costing 1 fewer fate point. The character may choose to gain +4   focus in a moment of clarity. If the target of the ability is concentrating, then the character may choose to interrupt that concentration as a fated effect. Finally, the character may instead choose to apply a fated effect to the ability.</p>

<p>Which fated effects a character may apply to the ability depend on the ability’s tags. Many ability tags, especially damage types, have fated effects specified in the table below.</p>

<p>All actions have at least one tag with a fated effect. If an ability has multiple tags with fated effects, then the character using the action can choose any one of the associated fated effects to apply.</p>

<p>If the fated ability is an attack, then the fated effect should be selected from the fated attack effects and applied to one target who yields. If it is a support action, then the effect should be chosen from the fated support effects table and applied to one target. Most fated or doomed effects come with bonus damage or vigor, which should be dealt to or received by the target, respectively.</p>

<p>Doomed abilities come with their own set of doomed effects. A doomed effect matching the ability’s tag may be chosen by the GM, typically at random, from the table of doomed effects. The GM will generally not add dice to the doom pool because of doomed actions, but they may in special circumstances.</p>

<p>Unlike talent and influence rolls, hostile NPCs treat fated and doomed actions the same way as players. Whenever such an NPC rolls above their fated action threshold, they may inflict a fated attack effect on their enemy or a fated support effect on their ally. When an NPC rolls a 1, their action suffers a doomed effect.</p>

<p>If a GM wants to apply a random doomed effect, roll a six-sided die. If it is a one or a two, apply the first or second melee or ranged effect, as appropriate. If it is a three or a four, apply the first or second attack or support effect. And if it is a five or a six, apply the first or second weapon or non-weapon effect.</p>

<h2 id="running-out-of-vigor">Running out of Vigor</h2>

<p>Having one type of vigor reduced to zero is a serious setback that can quickly lead to a character’s defeat if not managed.</p>

<p>When a character’s poise falls to zero, they are disarmed, when their momentum is reduced to zero, they become knocked-down, and when their focus is depleted, they become confused. Characters should consider the rearm, rise-up, and refocus actions to get back in fighting shape.</p>

<p>Whenever damage reduces a character’s poise, momentum, or agility to zero, any remaining damage is dealt to another vigor type of their choice.</p>

<h3 id="disarmed">Disarmed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can’t gain poise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot use any weapon or unarmed abilities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>All your abilities must target a random character or location within range.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot use any reactions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="defeat">Defeat</h2>

<p>Unless combatants flee or come to terms, combat will end in the defeat of one side or the other. A defeated character has had their focus, momentum and poise all reduced to zero, and is out of the fight. Any leftover damage dealt beyond their remaining vigor is added directly to their stress.</p>

<p>A defeated character can’t take any actions or reactions, can’t gain poise, momentum or focus, and the only maneuver they can use is to crawl two spaces. If they continue to take damage, their stress is increased by the damage dealt and they may begin to suffer afflictions.</p>

<p>The defeated character can recuperate from being defeated if they or another character spend 10 minutes tending to their wounds and restoring their strength. Once a character is no longer defeated, their poise momentum and focus are restored to their base values and they are ready to fight again. Being defeated doesn’t inherently carry any penalties. However, any stress and afflictions may linger for days, until a character has a chance to recover.</p>

<h2 id="mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</h2>

<p>Fighting from atop a horse or even a mythical flying beast can convey a huge advantage. In order to serve as a mount, a creature needs to be at least one size category larger than the character riding it. The creature must be willing, and many creatures require a saddle, harness, or other equipment to be ridden properly.</p>

<p>Climbing onto or off a mount requires three movement points. Whenever the mount moves, you move with it. While mounted, you and your mount share all the mount’s spaces. That means you can use abilities as if you where in any of the mount’s spaces, but abilities can also target you if they target any of the mount’s spaces. If you have a normal zone of control, then all spaces adjacent to the mount are within your zone of control. If an enemy hinders the mount’s movement, they may hinder either you or the mount.</p>

<p>While mounted, you use the mount’s momentum as if it were your own. Abilities that cause you to gain or lose momentum or take momentum damage cause the mount to gain or lose momentum or take damage instead. If either you or the mount becomes pushed, kneeling, or knocked-down, you fall from the mount and your momentum is reduced to 4 if it was higher. If you dismount intentionally, your momentum returns to what it was before you mounted the creature.</p>

<p>If the mount has only animal intelligence, like a horse, then you must use your turn to command it. Instead of your maneuver, the mount may use a maneuver, and instead of your action, the mount may use an action. It doesn’t use actions or maneuvers unless you use yours to command it. If the mount has any reactions, you may choose to use them whenever their requirements are met. Such mounts are not perfect, and may disobey you if they are put in very unusual situations.</p>

<p>If the mount is reasonably intelligent, then it acts on its own, taking its own turn during combat and using its own actions and maneuvers. You may use your actions and maneuvers independently while mounted, although you still share the mount’s momentum.</p>

<h2 id="water-combat">Water Combat</h2>

<p>Fighting while swimming can be extremely difficult for anyone unprepared. Moving while swimming requires two movement points for every space moved. While swimming in water, a character becomes wet and the wet condition can’t be removed. Spaces of water also count as wet terrain. All actions made while swimming suffer a bane, unless they are made with dagger or spear weapons, or they have the water or aquatic tag.</p>

<p>Unless a character can breathe underwater, they may become choking if they don’t hold their breath before plunging into the water. A character who holds their breath must follow the breath holding rules outlined above. While underwater, medium and long ranged abilities are reduced to short-ranged. Fire and audible abilities are ineffective if the user or target is underwater, as are ranged attacks from gun weapons. A character in a moving body of water may be carried along with the flow at the end of the combat round.</p>
