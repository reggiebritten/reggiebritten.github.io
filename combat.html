					<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>

<p><em>Victory is assured when all of your enemy’s choices lead to their defeat.</em></p>

<p>When words fail and retreat is not an option, you’ll need to draw your weapons and defeat your enemies. The GM will use these combat rules when you and your allies must fight though foes to achieve your goals. Combat occurs in a series of <a href="combat.html#turns--rounds">rounds</a>, where each round represents about 6 seconds of in game time. During each round, you can only use a limit number of <a href="skills.html">skills</a>, and only during your turn, so choose carefully.</p>

<p>The GM will describe the battlefield to you, and you will often need to <a href="combat.html#movement--position">move</a> into a better position to act. When you engage with the enemy, you will break their <a href="combat.html#defenses">defenses</a> with <a href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a> until you can ultimately <a href="combat.html#defeated">defeat</a> them. But watch out, they will try to do the same to you. If the tide of battle turns against you, you will begin to suffer <a href="stress.html">stress</a>. This stress will hinder you for days to come - if you even survive.</p>

<h2 id="turns--rounds">Turns &amp; Rounds</h2>

<p>Combat begins as soon as one character does something that other characters witness and are willing and able to oppose. That first acting character takes the first turn of combat. Any other characters may use a <a href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a> to immediately draw an <a href="equipment.html#weapon">weapons</a> they have equipped as the fray begins. If multiple characters attempt to act at exactly the same time, the GM will call for an <a href="rolls.html#opposed-rolls">opposed</a> <a href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a> roll to see who acts first.</p>

<p>You may use two <a href="skills.html">skills</a> on you turn, one <a href="skills.html#actions">actions</a> and one <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a>. Actions typically involve <a href="skills.html#attacks">attacking</a> enemies or supporting allies, while maneuvers typically involve moving to a better location or preparing for another skill. You may also use <a href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a> on your turn if their triggers as met. You must always finish one skill before starting another; you can’t move a few spaces with a maneuver, use an action, then finish the rest of the maneuver’s movement.</p>

<p>Once your have finished your turn, the GM will determine which of the characters who hasn’t acted yet this turn was most affected by your last turn. This could be the character you targeted with your action, the character to whom you dealt the most damage, or the character you ended your turn closest to, in that order. This could be one of your allies, but the GM will give preference to your enemies if everything else is equal. The <a href="wip.html#game-running/turn-order">turn order</a> section has more guidelines for the GM to determine who goes next.</p>

<p>This cycle continues until all characters have taken their turns, then the round ends. Legendary foes might be able to take multiple rounds in a single turn Some effects, especially environmental effects, do something at the end of the round. Once the round ends, all characters can take turns again, and the GM will start with the character most affected by the last turn of the previous round.</p>

<h3 id="legendary-turns">Legendary Turns</h3>

<p>Legendary creatures, like fearsome dragons, can often take multiple turns during each round of combat. During each of their turns, they get one <a href="skills.html#actions">action</a> and one <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a> as normal. Most legendary creatures are limited in how often they can use the same skill each round, but that varies by creature. If you apply a temporary condition to a legendary creature, then it lasts until both the creature and one of your allies both use actions.</p>

<h2 id="defenses">Defenses</h2>

<p>Emerge victorious, you will likely need to <a href="combat.html#damage--defeat">defeat</a> your enemies. That is achieved by reducing all their defenses to zero. Player characters and elite or legendary enemies have three defenses: poise, momentum, and focus.</p>

<p>The GM won’t normally ask you to keep track of your defenses outside of combat. Under normal circumstances, you begin combat at your base poise, base momentum, and base focus.</p>

<p>You can gain defense above these values, but doing so is likely to attract unwanted attention if you haven’t already. The GM will gain a point of <a href="wip.html#game-running/doom">doom</a> if you dally to gain defense in dangerous territory. When the adrenaline of combat fades, typically after about a minute, your poise momentum and focus return to their base values.</p>

<h3 id="poise">Poise</h3>

<p>Poise describes your precise balance and control of your weapons and fighting stance. Your base poise is equal to five plus five times your <a href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a>. When your poise is reduced to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, which weakens all your <a href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Skills that spend poise require precise coordination, while skills that gain poise let you regain your balance. Taking poise damage means being knocked off balance or being forced into an awkward position, and fighting atop a swaying bridge might cause a character to lose poise.</p>

<h3 id="momentum">Momentum</h3>

<p>Momentum describes how much physical force you can put into their movements. Your base momentum is equal to five plus five times your <a href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a>. When your momentum is reduced to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, which prevents you from moving.</p>

<p>A skill that slams down into the ground might cost momentum, while a skill that lets you surge forward might grant momentum. Effects that slam, push, or buffet you, like a mace strike or howling winds, might damage or reduce your momentum.</p>

<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>

<p>Focus represents your awareness of yourself, other character in the battle, and the battlefield itself. Your base focus is equal to five plus five times your <a href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>. When your focus is reduced to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a>, making you just as likely to target allies as enemies.</p>

<p>Skills that require intense attention will cost focus, but skills that gain focus only take a fleeting thought. Anything that draws a character’s attention away from the battle will deplete their focus, including an enemy’s projectile or a booming explosion.</p>

<h3 id="minions-defense">Minions’ Defense</h3>

<p>Many weaker NPCs, called minions, do not have poise, momentum, or focus. Instead, they simply have defense, which represents all three together. Whenever a minion would gain or lose poise, momentum or focus, their defense is adjusted by that amount instead.</p>

<h2 id="defending-vs-yielding">Defending vs Yielding</h2>

<p>When you are attacked, you must choose to either defend against or yield to the attack. Defending against an attack means taking damage equal to the attack’s threat to your choice of <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, or <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>. Your armor reduces the attack’s threat against you. If you successfully defend against an attack, then the attack’s yield never comes to pass; no dice are rolled and no other yield effects are applied.</p>

<p>Defending with poise is called dodging, defending with momentum is called blocking, and defending with focus is called predicting. Some attacks may be <a href="skills.html#undodgeable">undodgeable</a>, <a href="skills.html#unblockable">unblockable</a>, or <a href="skills.html#unpredictable">unpredictable</a>, preventing you from defending in those ways.</p>

<p>You can only defend against an attack with a specific defense if that defense is at least equal to the threat of the attack targeting you. For example, you cannot block  an attack with 11 threat (after subtracting your armor) if your remaining momentum is only 10. If you can’t block, dodge or predict an attack, then you have no choice but to <a href="combat.html#yield">yield</a> to it.</p>

<h3 id="yield">Yield</h3>

<p>An <a href="skills.html#attacks">attack’s</a> yield describes what the attack does if it is not <a href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defended</a> against. Each attack has a damage type (<a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, or <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>) and damage dice that you roll if the target yields. Add together all the dice to determine the amount of damage you do with the attack. If it is a  <a href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> attack, also add your  <a href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> to this damage. The target’s armor reduces the damage they take from an attack’s yield.</p>

<p>Furthermore, compare each individual die to your <a href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>. Each die that rolls equal to or below your cunning earns you a <a href="skills.html#cunning-effects">cunning effect</a>, in addition to the yield’s other effects!</p>

<h2 id="damage--defeat">Damage &amp; Defeat</h2>

<p>Damage will reduce your defenses and interfere with your ability to continue the fight. Most damage is dealt by <a href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a>, but objects and the environment can also deal damage.</p>

<p>If damage reduces your <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> falls to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, when your <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> is reduced to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, and when your <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> is depleted, you become <a href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a>. If all three pools are depleted, then you are defeated and excess damage carries over to your <a href="stress.html">stress</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reeling">Reeling</h3>

<p><strong><a href="conditions.html#persistent">Persistent</a></strong></p>

<p>A reeling character’s <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> has been reduce to zero, leaving them in a unable to coordinate an attack. While reeling, you can’t gain poise, you loose your <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and you suffer a <a href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> on all your <a href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="knocked-down">Knocked-Down</h3>

<p><strong><a href="conditions.html#persistent">Persistent</a></strong></p>

<p>A knocked-down character’s <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> has been reduce to zero, leaving them immobile on the ground. While knocked-down, you can’t gain momentum, you loose your <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and you can’t move except with the <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> skill.</p>

<h3 id="confused">Confused</h3>

<p><strong><a href="conditions.html#persistent">Persistent</a></strong></p>

<p>A confused character’s <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> has been reduced to zero, and they have lost track of the battle around them. While confused, you can’t gain focus, you loose your <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and all your skills target a random character within the skill’s range.</p>

<h3 id="defeated">Defeated</h3>

<p>Unless combatants flee or come to terms, combat will end in the defeat of one side or the other. A defeated character has had their <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> and <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> all reduced to zero, and is out of the fight. The remainder of any damage dealt beyond their current defense is dealt directly to your <a href="stress.html">stress</a> instead.</p>

<p>While you’re defeated, you are still conscious and can still talk. But you can’t take any <a href="skills.html#actions">actions</a> or <a href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a>, can’t gain <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> or <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>, you loose your <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, you’re <a href="skills.html#interrupting-concentration">interrupted</a> and can’t <a href="skills.html#concentration">concentrate</a> and the only maneuver you can use is to <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> one space. If you continue to take damage, your <a href="stress.html">stress</a> is increased by the damage dealt and they may begin to suffer afflictions.</p>

<p>Your can recuperate from being defeated if you or another character spend 10 minutes tending to your wounds and restoring your strength. Once you are no longer defeated, your poise momentum and focus are restored to their base values and you are ready to fight again. Being defeated doesn’t inherently carry any penalties. However, any stress and afflictions may linger for days, until you have a chance to recover.</p>

<h3 id="legendary-defiance">Legendary Defiance</h3>
<p>Legendary creatures are tough to take down for long. When a legendary creature is defeated, it can use a point of legendary defiance to stay in the fight. Using legendary defiance also grants the creature several other benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The creature roars, which automatically <a href="skills.html#interrupting-concentration">interrupts</a> all other character’s within earshot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All non-<a href="conditions.html#persistent">persistent</a> <a href="conditions.html">conditions</a> are removed form the creature, as well as the <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, <a href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, and <a href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a> conditions are removed from the creature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creature’s <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, and <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> are set to their base values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some creatures may raise the stakes of the battle in exciting ways after they use a certain amount of legendary defiance!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each legendary creature has a certain amount of legendary defiance points to use. After the creature has used all of them, you must defeat it one final time to finish it off once and for all!</p>

<h3 id="final-gambit">Final Gambit</h3>

<p>The most deadly warrior is a desperate one. You may invoke a final gambit on your turn, letting you push through any hardship for one last chance at victory. During the round of your final gambit, you gain several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can spend as much <a href="combat.html#defenses">defense</a> as you want on any <a href="skills.html">skill</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You ignore any banes on your skills and <a href="rolls.html">rolls</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You gain a boon on your skills and rolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <a href="abilities.html#speed">speed</a> increases by five.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, pushing your limits comes at a cost. After the round of your final gambit, your remaining defenses are all depleted, you are immediately <a href="combat.html#defeated">defeated</a>, and you suffer one <a href="stress.html">stress</a>. NPCs, including minions and legendary creatures, are also capable of final gambits, so never underestimate a foe.</p>

<h2 id="movement--position">Movement &amp; Position</h2>

<p>Movement is counted in spaces, where one space is equivalent to about 5 feet or 1½ meters. The most reliable way to get from place to place is the <a class="item" data-name="Dash">Dash</a> maneuver, which allows you to move 3 spaces plus your <a href="abilities.html#speed">speed</a>. However, using most <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> in an enemy’s <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a> carries a risk of being <a href="combat.html#hindering-maneuvers">hindered</a>, as described below. Another movement option is the <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> maneuver, which lets you move exactly 1 space. Since <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> has the <a href="skills.html#careful">careful</a> tag, it can ’t be hindered. Finally, the <a class="item" data-name="Sprint">Sprint</a> reaction lets a character trade <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> for a burst of speed.</p>

<p>There are a few rules that must be followed when you move. You can move freely through another friendly character’s space, but not an enemy’s. You can’t end their your in another character’s space; if you somehow find yourself sharing a space with another character, the GM will move one of you to an adjacent space.</p>

<p>Moving diagonally costs one space of movement the first time you move diagonally on a turn, then two spaces for the next time you move diagonally, repeating that pattern as they continue to move diagonally. You can’t move diagonally if the movement would cut through an impassable obstacle or a enemy’s space.</p>

<p>Some effects may require you to use additional movement to enter a space. If you can’t afford this extra movement, you can’t enter that space. Other effects prevent movement entirely, including any movement specified by a skill.</p>

<h3 id="shoving">Shoving</h3>

<p>Some skills will shove you in a specific direction. If you are shoved toward or away from something, each each space you are shoved into must be closer or further than the previous space, respectively.</p>

<p>Being shoved ignores movement restrictions from <a href="special-terrain.html">special terrain</a>. You can’t be shoved into a space occupied by another character or an obstacle. Instead, when you are shoved into an occupied space, you lose 2 <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> per remaining space you would have been pushed. You begin <a href="exploration.html#falling">falling</a> when you are shoved off a ledge, and any remaining distance you would be shoved is ignored.</p>

<p>The distance you are shoved is increased by one for each <a href="combat.html#size">size</a> larger than you the character shoving you is. Likewise, the distance you are shoved is reduced for each size smaller than you they are, to a minimum of zero spaces.</p>

<h3 id="high-ground">High Ground</h3>

<p>A space that is about 3 feet or 1 meter higher than another space counts as higher ground. Moving up to higher ground costs an additional movement point, but you may move two spaces downward for each point of movement. A gradual slope may require moving laterally several spaces to ascend or descend one space.</p>

<p>Your <a href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> <a href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a> gain a <a href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> against targets on lower ground, but your melee attacks suffer a <a href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> against targets on higher ground. When you use a ranged skill from higher or lower ground, add or subtract the height difference to the <a href="skills.html#ranged">range</a> of the skill, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="cover">Cover</h3>

<p>Any <a href="skills.html">skill</a> that passes through a space containing an obstacle or another character suffers a <a href="skills.html#banes">bane</a>. Attack, utility, ranged, and melee skills can all be penalized by cover. The obstacle might be a tree, a corner, a low wall, or anything else that would partially block your view of the target. Remember than you can’t normally target a character that you can’t see at all.</p>

<p>You can’t normally pop out from behind cover, attack, then duck back into cover all on your turn. However, some objects, like a low wall or an arrow slit, might provide cover for you but not interfere with your skills.</p>

<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<p>Your size describes how big you are and how much space you take up. A normal human’s size is 1. A character with a size larger than one takes up a square with each side made of spaces equal to their size, so a size 3 character takes up a three by three square, or nine spaces in total.</p>

<p>Smaller character are described with lower numbers, such as 0, -1, -2, and so on. Such creatures normally still take up one entire space, but the GM may allow characters of significantly different sizes to share a space. Different sizes don’t come with any inherent bonuses or penalties, but may become relevant for certain <a href="skills.html">skills</a> or <a href="conditions.html">conditions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="disarmed">Disarmed</h3>

<p>When you become disarmed, everything you are holding is thrown three spaces away in random directions, including wielded <a href="equipment.html#weapon">weapons</a>. You will need to draw new weapons or reverie your old ones to stay in fighting shape.</p>

<h2 id="zone-of-control">Zone of Control</h2>

<p>Your zone of control, sometimes abbreviated as “ZoC”, is the area of the battlefield where you can interfere with an enemy. Any <a href="skills.html#ranged">ranged</a> skill used while in an enemy’s zone of control suffers a <a href="skills.html#banes">bane</a>. Your zone of control also determines where you can <a href="combat.html#hindering-maneuvers">hinder</a> <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> and when you have an enemy <a href="combat.html#surrounded">surrounded</a>.</p>

<p>A character armed with a <a href="equipment.html#weapon">weapon</a> with the <a href="equipment.html#ZoC">ZoC</a> tag, typically a weapon used for melee combat, has a zone of control that includes their own space and all spaces adjacent to them. You don’t have a zone of control if you don’t have a ZOC weapon, although some creatures might. You might temporarily loose your zone of control while you are <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, <a href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, confused, or affected by certain other <a href="conditions.html">conditions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hindering-maneuvers">Hindering Maneuvers</h3>

<p>Using most <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> while engaged with the enemy is risky. Whenever you use a maneuver in an enemy character’s <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone-of-control</a>, that enemy can hinder you. When you are hindered, you immediately lose -2 <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, -2 <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, and -2 <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>. Hindering is not an attack; there is no threat or yield and your <a href="equipment.html#armor">armor</a> doesn’t reduce the loss.</p>

<p>You may enter a hostile character’s zone of control without being hindered, but using a maneuver to move from within an enemy zone of control allows that enemy to hinder you. A skill with the <a href="skills.html#careful">careful</a> tag can’t be hindered. <a href="skills.html#actions">Actions</a> and <a href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a> also can’t be hindered, even if they let you move. However far you move, each enemy can only hinder you once per maneuver.</p>

<h3 id="surrounded">Surrounded</h3>

<p>You might become surrounded if you have multiple enemies or obstacles closing off your retreat. <a href="skills.html#attacks">Attacks</a> gain a <a href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> against you while you are surrounded.</p>

<p>In simple terms, you are surrounded if you can’t leave an enemy’s <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>. More precisely, you are surrounded if you are within the zone of control of one or more enemies, and every adjacent space into which you could move is also within the zone of control of at least one of those enemies. You are also surrounded if you have two enemies with active zones of control on directly opposite corners of you.</p>

<p>Even if you can’t move, or could teleport, the adjacent spaces into which you could hypothetically move should be considered. If an obstacle prevents movement into a space, that space doesn’t need to be in an enemy’s zone of control for you to be surrounded. You are not surrounded as long as you could leave the zones of control you are currently in, even if it means moving into someone else’s zone of control. Since you can move into the space of a friendly character, a space occupied by a friendly character doesn’t count against you to determine if you are surrounded, unless it is also in an enemy’s zone of control.</p>

<h2 id="mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</h2>

<p>Fighting from atop a horse or even a mythical flying beast can convey a huge advantage. In order to serve as a mount, a creature needs to be at least one <a href="combat.html#size">size</a> category larger than you. The creature must be willing, and many creatures require a saddle, harness, or other equipment to be ridden properly.</p>

<p>Whenever the mount moves, you move with it. While mounted, you and your mount share all the mount’s spaces. That means you can use <a href="skills.html">skills</a> as if you where in any of the mount’s spaces, but skills can also target you if they target any of the mount’s spaces. If you have a normal <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, then all spaces adjacent to the mount are within your zone of control. If an enemy <a href="combat.html#hindering-maneuvers">hinders</a> the mount’s movement, they may hinder either you or the mount.</p>

<p>While mounted, you use the mount’s <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> as if it were your own. Skills and effects that cause you to gain or lose momentum or take momentum damage cause the mount to gain or lose momentum or take damage instead. If either you or the mount are <a href="combat.html#shoving">shoved</a>, <a href="conditions.html#kneeling">kneeling</a>, or <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, you fall from the mount and your momentum is reduced to 4 if it was higher. If you dismount intentionally, your momentum returns to what it was before you mounted the creature. Depending on your mount’s size, and the battlefield around you, your mount might give you the benefits of <a href="combat.html#high-ground">high ground</a>, as determined by the GM.</p>

<p>If the mount has only animal intelligence, like a horse, then you must use your turn to command it. Instead of your <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a>, the mount may use a maneuver, and instead of your <a href="skills.html#actions">action</a>, the mount may use an action. It doesn’t use actions or maneuvers unless you use yours to command it. If the mount has any <a href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a>, you may choose to use them whenever their triggers are met. Such mounts are not perfect, and may disobey you if they are put in unfamiliar situations.</p>

<p>If the mount is reasonably intelligent, then it acts on its own, taking its own turn during combat and using its own actions and maneuvers. You may use your actions and maneuvers independently while mounted, although you still share the mount’s momentum.</p>

<h2 id="combat-in-water">Combat in Water</h2>

<p>Fighting while swimming can be extremely difficult if you are unprepared. Spaces of water count as <a href="special-terrain.html#wet-terrain">wet-terrain</a>, and require an extra point of movement for every space moved. You automatically become <a href="conditions.html#wet">wet</a> while swimming, and the wet condition is instantly reapplied if it is ever removed. All your <a href="skills.html">skills</a> suffer a <a href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> while you are swimming, unless they are made with a <a class="item" data-name="Dagger">Dagger</a>, <a class="item" data-name="Short Spear">Short Spear</a>, or similar weapon. The GM may further rule that some skills are impossible or have other penalties underwater.</p>

<p>If you are unexpectedly plunged under water, you suffer the <a href="conditions.html#choking">choking</a> condition, and that condition is <a href="conditions.html#persistent">persistent</a> while you remain under water. However, if you intentionally hold your breath on your turn, you are immune to the choking condition, but you lose -2 <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> and -2 <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> at the end of your turn. See the <a href="exploration.html#breath-holding">breath holding</a> rules for dives lasting longer than a few rounds.</p>
