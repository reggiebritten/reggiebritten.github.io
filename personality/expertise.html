<h2 id="expertise">Expertise</h2>

<p>Your expertise describes tasks that you are uniquely excellent. This mastery comes from the details of your history, such as where you are from, who you have known, and how you came to do what you’re doing now. You don’t decide your expertise when creating your character; your expertise is revealed through <a href="flashbacks.md">flashbacks</a> as you play the game.</p>

<p>Expertise is not chosen from a specific list. Instead, expertise is a short phrase that describes your talent. Expertise much be specific enough that it doesn’t apply to just any situation, but general enough that it will be useful throughout your adventure. For example, you might have expertise that you serve aboard a specific sailing ship. Your expertise would help you with anything related to the ship, including the crew, construction, and exploits of the ship. But such expertise wouldn’t help you with other different kinds of ships. The GM will help you adjust your expertise to be appropriately specific. Some example phrases of expertise are given here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve trekked every corner of the august valley.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was swindled by a traveling salesman, I’ll never let it happen again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court of Lataris recognizes me as a minor noble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the red wastes, you don’t survive if you can’t lay low.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The red hand tribe of orcs killed my family; I’ll get my revenge.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your expertise is relevant to a <a href="...html#rolls">roll</a>, then it gives you a <a href="...html#rolls\boons--banes">boon</a> to that roll. If multiple sources of expertise are helpful, then you gain a boon for each!</p>

<h3 id="flashbacks-wip2">Flashbacks #WIP2</h3>

<p>When your character achieves certain goals, the GM will reward you with the opportunity for a flashback. A flashback is a chance to explore a detail of your character’s past. When you resolve a flashback, discuss with the GM what detail you would like to explore.</p>

<p>If the GM agrees that the proposed embellishment is reasonable in the context of the character’s existing background, then the player may spend a point of fate to add the embellishment to their character’s background.</p>

<p>In general, embellishing a character’s background is easier if fewer details have already been established, and if the detail being added is consistent with the background details that the character already has. The GM should be more permissive of characters who have few background details already established or few that have aided them on their quest so far. Everyone comes from somewhere, and all characters are entitles to backgrounds that help them achieve their goals.</p>
