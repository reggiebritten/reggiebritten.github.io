<h2 id="expertise">Expertise</h2>

<p>Your expertise describes tasks at which you are uniquely excellent! If your expertise is relevant to a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">roll</a>, then it gives you a <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html#boons--banes">boon</a> to that roll. If multiple sources of expertise are helpful, then you gain a boon for each! This mastery comes from the details of your history, such as where you are from, who you have known, and how you came to do what you’re doing now. You don’t decide your expertise when creating your character; your expertise is discovered through <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#flashbacks">flashbacks</a> as you play the game.</p>

<p>Expertise is not chosen from a specific list. Instead, expertise is a short phrase that describes your talent. Expertise much be specific enough that it doesn’t apply to just any situation, but general enough that it will be useful throughout your adventure. The GM will help you adjust your expertise to be appropriately specific, but a good guideline is that your expertise should include the name of a specific person, place, or thing.</p>

<p>For example, you might have expertise that you served aboard the SS Windsinger. That expertise would help you with anything related to the ship, including the crew, construction, and exploits of the ship. But such expertise wouldn’t help you with other different kinds of ships. Some example phrases of expertise are given here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve trekked every corner of the August Valley.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was swindled by the Merchant’s Guild, I’ll never let it happen again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court of Lataris recognizes me as a minor noble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Dust Dunes, you don’t survive if you can’t lay low.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Red Hand tribe of orcs killed my family; I’ll get my revenge.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flashbacks">Flashbacks</h3>

<p>A flashback is a chance to explore an important unanswered question about your character’s past. A flashback is triggered for you when another character is prompted by in-game events to ask you about your past. The question must come from a character other than yours, and it must be that character asking your character, not the player asking you as a player. NPCs, as well as your fellow player characters, can ask you questions that trigger a flashback. Furthermore, the question must be directly and clearly related to a recent in-game event, such as an NPC that was recently met, a location recently visited, or an item recently acquired or used. Out of the blue questions with no context to prompt them do not trigger flashbacks. You are free to ask the GM if a question has triggered a flashback, but the GM has the final say.</p>

<p>When the GM tells you that a question has triggered a flashback, imagine how your character’s past has led up to the recent events related to the question. You are free to suggest any connection you can imagine. The GM will determine if your proposed history conflicts with other elements of the game world. If there is no conflict, then your flashback becomes an established fact of your history! Write it down as <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#expertise">expertise</a> that you can call upon to aid you in your future adventures.</p>

<p>If you have a character trait in mind, one appropriate way to invite a flashback is to express it as a character <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#character-flaws">flaw</a> that poses an obstacle for you. Your allies might see you struggling, and ask what is troubling you. The GM will likely agree that this triggers a flashback, and you can explain the source of your difficulties. However, this will only work if your allies think to inquire about your flaw! If it doesn’t occur to anyone to ask, then there is no flashback. Keep an eye out for opportunities to ask your allies about their past so that they can earn flashbacks, and the will repay the favor!</p>
