<h2 id="indulgences">Indulgences</h2>

<p>Indulgences are your character’s favorite activities, experiences, and pastimes. As you play the game you will discover your character’s indulgences, which will relive stress when you parted of them. An indulgence is a pleasant activity that is difficult, risky, costly, or otherwise rare but enjoyable for your character to do. Indulgences are only special if they are uncommon, and an old indulgence that becomes commonplace may no longer feel as special as it once did.</p>
