<h2 id="backgrounds--identity">Backgrounds &amp; Identity</h2>

<p>The first step of creating your character is randomly determining your character’s <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#background--identity">backgrounds</a>. You may not establish any details about your character until after randomly determining your backgrounds. To determine your character’s backgrounds roll three 20-sided dice, and reroll any duplicate numbers. The table below will tell you your character’s three backgrounds based on the three numbers you rolled:</p>

<p>Once you’ve determined your character’s backgrounds, imagine a common thread that would tie these three backgrounds together, and a core motivation for your character. Write this down as your character’s <strong>identity</strong>, a 3 to 5 word phrase summarizing who your character is and what they desire. Some example identities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Noble Knight Fighting for Justice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Streetwise Scoundrel Seeking Safety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brilliant Magus Amassing Power</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fallen Disciple Seeking Redemption</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mamma Bear Protecting the Pack</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of your backgrounds also grants you one <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#bonds">bond</a>, related to your background’s origin. These bonds are short descriptions of how, where and with whom you learned your expertise. This bond need not be decided right away; you should save the opportunity to connect your past with the events of your current adventures.</p>

<p>Your backgrounds describe your life before your current adventures, and improve any <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">rolls</a> that benefit from that history. You should try to leverage your background when approaching problems, and ask the GM if any of your backgrounds would help when you make a roll. If the GM agrees that it would help, add a +2 bonus to your <strong>TN</strong> for the roll. Some tasks may only be attempted by a character who has a necessary background. When the GM calls for a <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#lore-checks">lore check</a>, each different background that is relevant grants you +2 to your result.</p>
