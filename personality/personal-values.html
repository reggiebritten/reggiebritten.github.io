<h2 id="personal-values">Personal Values</h2>

<p>While all people have a unique set of traits, principles, and motives, Forge of Legends focuses on six personal values in particular. These values come in three opposing pairs: bold vs. subtle, idealistic vs. pragmatic and serious vs. whimsical.</p>

<p>Your character has a rating from one to five in each value. A rating of one or two means that you are <strong>opposed</strong> to the value, while a rating of four or five means that you are <strong>aligned</strong> with the value. A rating of exactly three means you are <strong>neutral</strong> on that scale. Opposite pairs of values always add up to exactly 6; whenever one value is increased, the opposite value is decreased. If you have a bold rating of 3, you must also be subtle 3; if you are serious 5, you must be whimsical 1. Other than that restriction, you may set their characters’ personal values to anything you wish when creating your character.</p>

<p>Your personal values determine how you respond to <a href="fate.html#fateful-deeds">fateful deeds</a>. You are rewarded with a fate point when you perform a fateful deed that is aligned with your values, but risk suffering <a href="stress.html">stress</a> when you perform a fateful deed opposed to your values. Fateful deeds are also the only way to change your values once you have set them.</p>

<p>Your personal values are also used for <a href="rolls.html">rolls</a> you make to influence other NPCs (You can’t roll to influence other player characters). Such a roll will always be <a href="rolls.html#opposed-rolls">opposed</a> by one of the NPC’s values, although the GM will determine which of those values will oppose you. For example, if you try to boldly intimidate a guard, the guard’s bold value will oppose you. The task is easier if the guard is subtle, and more difficult if they are bold. On the other hand, if you try to pragmatically bribe the guard, then the guard’s idealistic value will oppose you. The task is easier if the guard is more pragmatic like you, and more difficult if they are idealistic.</p>

<h3 id="bold-vs-subtle">Bold vs Subtle</h3>

<p>Bold and subtle describe a character’s approach to <strong>overcoming obstacles</strong>. A bold character would <strong>confront</strong> an challenge directly, but a subtle character would <strong>bypass</strong> a direction confrontation. A bold character might see themselves as brave, daring, and straightforward, while they see might subtle characters as cowardly, manipulative, or meek. A subtle character sees themselves as patient, wise, and careful, but bold characters as impatient, shortsighted, or reckless.</p>

<h3 id="idealistic-vs-pragmatic">Idealistic vs Pragmatic</h3>

<p>Idealistic and pragmatic describe how a character responds to <strong>unpleasant opportunities</strong>. An idealistic character would <strong>renounce</strong> a beneficial but distasteful opportunity, but a pragmatic character would <strong>exploit</strong> such an opportunity. An idealistic character sees themselves as honorable, fair, and someone who does the right thing, while they might see a pragmatic character as unscrupulous, selfish, or downright evil. A pragmatic character sees themselves as realistic, practical and someone who does what needs to be done, while they might describe an idealistic character as a zealot, a wishful thinker, or gullible.</p>

<h3 id="serious-vs-whimsical">Serious vs Whimsical</h3>

<p>Serious and Whimsical describe how a character responds to <strong>intriguing diversions</strong>. A serious character would <strong>persist</strong> toward their main objective, while a whimsical character would <strong>explore</strong> the new circumstance. A serious character sees themselves as tenacious, decisive, and calm, but might see a whimsical character as unreliable, lazy, or overly excitable. A whimsical character sees themselves as friendly, flexible, and passionate, while they might see a serious character as dour, stubborn, and cold.</p>
