<h2 id="personality-traits">Personality Traits</h2>

<p>While all people have a unique set of values, principles, and motives, Forge of Legends focuses on six personality traits in particular. These personality traits come in three opposing pairs: bold vs. subtle, idealistic vs. pragmatic and serious vs. whimsical.
Each character has a trait rating from zero to six in each trait. A rating of zero to two means that the character is <strong>opposed</strong> to the trait, while a rating of four to six means that the character is <strong>aligned</strong> with the trait. A rating of exactly three means the character is <strong>neutral</strong>.
Opposite pairs of traits always add up to exactly 6; whenever one trait is increased, the opposite trait is decreased and vice versa. If a character has a bold rating of 3, they must also be subtle 3; if they are serious 5, they must be whimsical 1. Other than that restriction, players may set their characters’ personality trait ratings to anything they wish when creating their character. But one set, personality traits can only change as the results of fateful deeds, described below.</p>
<h3 id="bold--subtle">Bold / Subtle</h3>

<p>Bold and subtle describe a character’s approach to <strong>overcoming obstacles</strong>. A bold character would <strong>confront</strong> an challenge directly, but a subtle character would <strong>bypass</strong> a direction confrontation. A bold character might see themselves as brave, daring, and straightforward, while they see might subtle characters as cowardly, manipulative, or meek. A subtle character sees themselves as patient, wise and careful, but bold characters as impatient, shortsighted, or reckless.</p>

<h3 id="idealistic--pragmatic">Idealistic / Pragmatic</h3>

<p>Idealistic and Pragmatic describe how a character responds to an <strong>unpleasant opportunity</strong>. An idealistic character would <strong>renounce</strong> a beneficial but distasteful opportunity, but a pragmatic character would <strong>exploit</strong> such an opportunity. An idealistic character sees themselves as honorable, fair, and someone who does the right thing, while they might see a pragmatic character as unscrupulous, selfish, or downright evil. A pragmatic character sees themselves as realistic, practical and someone who does what needs to be done, while they might describe an idealistic character as a zealot, a wishful thinker, or gullible.</p>

<h3 id="serious--whimsical">Serious / Whimsical</h3>

<p>Serious and Whimsical describe how a character responds to <strong>intriguing diversions</strong>. A serious character would <strong>persist</strong> toward their main objective, while a whimsical character would <strong>explore</strong> the new circumstance. A serious character sees themselves as tenacious, decisive, and calm, but might see a whimsical character as unreliable, lazy, or overly excitable. A whimsical character sees themselves as friendly, flexible, and passionate, while they might see a serious character as dour, stubborn, and cold.</p>
