<h3 id="discussions">Discussions</h3>

<p>If a group character’s have differing opinion about a fateful deed, they may discuss their views with one another. Each player may roleplay their character’s viewpoint and sincerely advocate for what their character would do. After a character participates in a discussion, they are satisfied that they have spoken up for their beliefs and been shown higher priorities by their companions. If the group eventually comes to a decision to which such a character is <strong>opposed</strong>, the character nonetheless gains a point of fate does not suffer any stress as a result of having participated in the discussion. The heroes of Forge of Legends may have colorful personalities, but they always find a way to put aside their differences to achieve their goals.</p>
