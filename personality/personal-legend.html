<h2 id="personal-legend">Personal Legend</h2>

<p>Your character’s personal legend is a story and power completely unique to them! A personal legend must include 3 things: An origin, a manifestation, and a mystery. Not all the details of your personal legend need to be established right away. Personal legends can and do change over time. It may even be that a you haven’t yet discovered your personal legend when the game begins, only for it to be revealed later in a moment of crisis.</p>

<h3 id="origin">Origin</h3>

<p>The origin of your legend is a brief description of how you came to acquire or understand your personal legend. It may come from your bloodline, one of your past deeds, or years of dedicated training. However, a personal legend is always tied to your character themselves, not an item that your character possesses.</p>

<h3 id="manifestation">Manifestation</h3>

<p>The manifestation of a personal legend is a supernatural ability or power that your has, usually in the form of a unique skill. You should suggest the nature of the manifestation to the GM, who will then offer the specific effects and limitations. The GM Guidelines chapter includes additional information for designing legendary manifestations.</p>

<h3 id="mystery">Mystery</h3>

<p>Finally, every personal legend needs a mystery. There may still be unanswered questions or unresolved conflicts about the origin, you may not fully understand your manifestation, or you may be uncertain of how the legend will affect your future. A mystery is a loose thread that the GM can weave into an adventure. If the GM feels like it is difficult to incorporate your character’s mystery into any adventure, then they will ask you to elaborate that mystery.</p>

<p>By their nature, legendary mysteries entice characters to seek their answers. Discovering the resolution to a mystery rewards you with a new manifestation of your personal legend, which may enhance or even replace their old manifestation. Resolving a mystery doesn’t just spell the end of one chapter of your personal legend. It also marks the begging of another. Wherever you discover the answer to a mystery, the GM will work with you to decide what new mystery has arisen. A personal legend must always have some unanswered questions.</p>
