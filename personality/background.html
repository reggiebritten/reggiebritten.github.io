<h2 id="backgrounds-wip">Backgrounds <strong>WIP</strong></h2>
<p>Your backgrounds describe your life before your current adventures, and improve any <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">rolls</a> that benefit from that history. When you create your character, randomly select <strong>3</strong> of the backgrounds from the list below. You should try to leverage your background when approaching problems, and ask the GM if any of your backgrounds would help when you make a roll. If the GM agrees that it would help, add a +2 bonus to your <strong>TN</strong> for the roll. Some tasks may only be attempted by a character who has a necessary background. <br />
Each of your backgrounds also grants you a <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#bonds">bond</a>, related to your background’s origin. These bonds are short descriptions of how, where and with whom you learned your expertise. This bond need not be decided right away; you should save the opportunity to connect your past with the events of your current adventures. <br />
