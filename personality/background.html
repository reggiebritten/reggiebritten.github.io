<h2 id="background-details">Background Details</h2>

<p>A character’s background details describe the whole collection of experiences they have had over their life. This could include old and mundane information such as where a character was born and who their family is. But it can also include new and fantastic details such as recent adventures.
All these background details may become relevant for challenges and lore checks. If a player believes that one or more of a character’s background details would provide them with valuable insight or experience toward achieving their goal, they should point the connection out to the GM. Even players who are not involved in the roll may point out how another character’s background is helpful in a given situation. The GM may ask the player how that experience is relevant, and if the GM agrees, then then detail aids the character.
Players should write down as much information about their character as they think is relevant, with the GM’s permission. However, it is okay if a player doesn’t have their character’s entire background detailed when the character is first created, because a character’s background can always be embellished.</p>
<h3 id="embellishing-a-background">Embellishing a Background</h3>

<p>At any time, a character may ask to embellish their background by adding more details. This is a kind of twist of fate and follows all the same rules, such as only adding detail and not changing established facts. If the GM agrees that the proposed embellishment is reasonable in the context of the character’s existing background, then the player may spend a point of fate to add the embellishment to their character’s background.
In general, embellishing a character’s background is easier if fewer details have already been established, and if the detail being added is consistent with the background details that the character already has. The GM should be more permissive of characters who have few background details already established or few that have aided them on their quest so far. Everyone comes from somewhere, and all characters are entitles to backgrounds that help them achieve their goals.</p>

<h3 id="flaws--fate">Flaws &amp; Fate</h3>

<p>The characters of Forge of Legends are still just people, and often come with their own weakness, foibles, and flaws. But fate smiles upon those who admit their shortcomings. A character’s flaws are background details just like any others. However, whenever a character’s flaws or other background details create a significant problem for the character or group, as determined by the GM, that character gains a point of fate. Characters with interesting flaws or double-edged background details will find more opportunities to be favored by fate.</p>
