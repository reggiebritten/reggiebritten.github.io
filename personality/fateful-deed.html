<h2 id="fateful-deeds">Fateful Deeds</h2>

<p>A fateful deed is an important decision made in the spirit of one of the six personality traits. A fateful deed could be something a character says, does, or even doesn’t do, but it must always be a significant, informed, and voluntary choice by a character.
When considering weather or not a situation should qualify as a fateful deed, the GM should think back to the personality traits: Is there a significant obstacle in the players’ path that might be confronted or avoided? Is there an unpleasant opportunity that might be renounced or exploited? Is there an intriguing diversion that may draw the players’ away from their current course? The GM should attempt to let players know in advance when one of their actions will be considered a fateful deed, but fateful deeds may also be declared in hindsight if applicable. Players should also nominate each other’s actions for fateful deeds, but the GM makes the final decision.
When a choice is declared to be a fateful deed, the GM will specify which of the six personality traits most closely matches the situation. Any character involved in the deed should compare their personality traits to that specified by the GM. But characters who are unaware of or unable to influence the deed are not included.
If a character’s traits are <strong>aligned</strong> with the fateful deed, then that character gains one point of fate! The character may also choose to strengthen their beliefs increasing the rating of that personality trait by one (up to six) and reducing the opposite trait by an equal amount.
If a character is <strong>opposed</strong> the fateful deed, the character faces a dilemma. The character may admit that their priorities have changed, and shift their trait ratings one in the direction of the fateful deed (decreasing the opposite rating). Alternatively, the character may hold fast to their values, but the dissonance between their deeds and their beliefs causes then two points of stress.
If the character is <strong>neutral</strong> toward the trait of the fateful deed, then they may choose to increase that trait rating by one (decreasing the opposite trait), but they do not gain fate or suffer stress.</p>

<h3 id="discussions">Discussions</h3>

<p>If a group character’s have differing opinion about a fateful deed, they may discuss their views with one another. Each player may roleplay their character’s viewpoint and sincerely advocate for what their character would do. After a character participates in a discussion, they are satisfied that they have spoken up for their beliefs and been shown higher priorities by their companions. If the group eventually comes to a decision to which such a character is <strong>opposed</strong>, the character nonetheless gains a point of fate does not suffer any stress as a result of having participated in the discussion. The heroes of Forge of Legends may have colorful personalities, but they always find a way to put aside their differences to achieve their goals.</p>
