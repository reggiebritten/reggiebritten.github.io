<h2 id="fate">Fate</h2>

<p>Heroes, especially those who stay true to themselves and to their friends, often find that destiny is on their side. Fate is a resource that you and your allies can call upon to aid you in your adventures. However, the GM will keep track of your group’s fate secretly; you can never be quite sure if fate will answer your call.</p>

<p>You earn fate by performing <strong>fateful deeds</strong>, important decisions made in alignment with your <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#personal-values">personal values</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#bonds">bonds</a>, or other priorities. You also gain a point of fate whenever one of your character’s flaws poses a significant obstacle. The decisions you make with your group can also qualify as fateful deeds, especially if you strongly advocate for what you believe in. The GM will determine if any of your decisions qualify as fateful deeds, and when they do, the GM will increase your group’s fate. The GM might communicate that you have earned a fateful deed by describing a benign event in the game world, such as a rainbow appearing. But the GM may also increase your fate silently.</p>

<p>You may call upon fate with a silent prayer for aid in your time of need. If your group has enough fate, and if fate doesn’t oppose your intentions, then your call will be answered and fate will aid in your endeavors. This will most often take the form of granting a boon to one of your rolls, even after you roll the dice. You will discover other ways to call upon fate as you learn about the world. However, fate will only ever answer your call after you commit to undertaking a course of action. Fortune favors the bold; and you can never know if you luck has run out until its too late!</p>
