<h3 id="origin">Origin</h3>

<p>The origin of your legend is a brief description of how you came to acquire or understand your personal legend. It may come from your bloodline, one of your past deeds, or years of dedicated training. However, a personal legend is always tied to your character themselves, not an item that your character possesses.</p>
