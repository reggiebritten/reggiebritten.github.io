<h2 id="lore-checks">Lore Checks</h2>

<p>The GM will ask you for a lore check to determine what you know about a specific subject. If you have any training that would give you insight in the subject, each adds +2 to your lore check. If you have relevant expertise, each adds +4. If your allies have training or expertise that would offer a different perspective, you all can pool your knowledge together to determine how much you know. However, if you and your ally have the same training, it is only counted once for a lore check.
Once you’ve added up your relevant training and expertise, the GM will determine how much you know about the subject and tell you your insights. No dice are rolled to determine what you know; either you have enough experience from your background, or you don’t. If it turns out you don’t know enough lore, you’re encouraged to seek out people, books, or research to learn more.
