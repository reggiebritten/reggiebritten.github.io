<h2 id="training-wip">Training <strong>WIP</strong></h2>

<p>Your training describes your familiarity with certain tasks, and benefits your <a href="rolls.html">rolls</a> related to those tasks. When you create your character, select 7 tasks from the list below in which your character is trained. When the GM calls for a roll, you should ask if your training would help with the task. If the GM agrees that it would help, add a +2 bonus to your TN for the roll. Some tasks may only be attempted by a character who has the necessary training.</p>
