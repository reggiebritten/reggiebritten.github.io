<h2 id="bonds">Bonds</h2>

<p>Your bonds describe the specific people, places and things with which you have a unique connection. Bonds are not chosen from a specific list. Instead, bonds come in the form of short phrases that describe your relationships. A bond much be specific enough that it doesn’t apply to just any situation, but general enough that it will be useful throughout your adventure. The GM will help you adjust your bonds to be appropriately specific. Some example bonds are given here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve trekked every corner of the August Valley.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was trained under the masterful tutelage of Zenzara.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court of Lataris recognizes me as a minor noble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Dust Dunes, you don’t survive if you can’t lay low.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Gordothi orcs killed my family.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You begin play with six incomplete bonds, questions that you may answer when you see fit: Who was your family? Where did you come from? How did you learn the skills of your class? And for each of your three <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#background--identity">backgrounds</a>, what did you do? You are free to declare your answer to these at any time, but you are encouraged to wait and see what the world is like before deciding your place in it. During your adventure, you will have the chance to <a class = "keyword" href="downtime.html#building-bonds">build bonds</a> with the fantastic people, places, and things you meet along the way.</p>
