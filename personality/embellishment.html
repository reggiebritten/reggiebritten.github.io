<h3 id="embellishing-a-background">Embellishing a Background</h3>

<p>At any time, a character may ask to embellish their background by adding more details. This is a kind of twist of fate and follows all the same rules, such as only adding detail and not changing established facts. If the GM agrees that the proposed embellishment is reasonable in the context of the character’s existing background, then the player may spend a point of fate to add the embellishment to their character’s background.
In general, embellishing a character’s background is easier if fewer details have already been established, and if the detail being added is consistent with the background details that the character already has. The GM should be more permissive of characters who have few background details already established or few that have aided them on their quest so far. Everyone comes from somewhere, and all characters are entitles to backgrounds that help them achieve their goals.</p>
