<p>Finally, every personal legend needs a mystery. There may still be unanswered questions or unresolved conflicts about the origin, you may not fully understand your manifestation, or you may be uncertain of how the legend will affect your future. A mystery is a loose thread that the GM can weave into an adventure. If the GM feels like it is difficult to incorporate a character’s mystery into any adventure, then they will ask you to elaborate that mystery.</p>

<p>By their nature, legendary mysteries entice characters to seek their answers. Discovering the resolution to a mystery rewards you with a new manifestation of your personal legend, which may enhance or even replace their old manifestation. Resolving a mystery doesn’t just spell the end of one chapter of your personal legend. It also marks the begging of another. Wherever you discover the answer to a mystery, the GM will work with you to decide what new mystery has arisen. A personal legend must always have some unanswered questions.</p>
