<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Forge of Legends is a heroic fantasy tabletop roleplaying game best played with three to five players and a gamemaster. Players will create and play as mighty heroes destined for greatness. In a setting designed and orchestrated by the gamemaster, player characters must work together to forage through foreboding forests, delve into dangerous dungeons, and vanquish vicious villains! Every legendary deed is symbolized by a legendary item, ensuring the heroes’ legacy will last for ages!</p>

<p>Forge of Legends features fate as a central mechanic. Fate lets the players add detail to the game world beyond the actions of their characters. But where there is fate, doom is not far behind, nipping at the heels of the players to keep the action moving.</p>

<p>With the help of the GM, the players will create characters from familiar fantasy races and classes, like elves, dwarves, warriors, and wizards. Regardless of class, all characters gain access to powerful abilities both in and out of combat.</p>

<p>Each character also has a unique personality, and players are rewarded for embracing their character’s personality through fateful deeds. Every character can leverage their personality to interact with NPCs in different ways; in Forge of Legends, everyone shares the spotlight. Characters each have a personal legend, based on their history, which grants them custom powers and capabilities.</p>

<p>Combat in Forge of Legends is deep and strategic. Players must balance three distinct resource pools, and each attack offers the target a choice how they will suffer its effects. A wide variety of fated effects, conditions, and special terrains ensure that every fight is interesting and dynamic.</p>

<p>As characters overcome obstacles and defeat enemies, they can access to new and exciting abilities. However, while this growth gives them additional options, characters must always choose a finite set of abilities for their fighting style. Players will never be bogged down by too many options, and even the lowliest foe can prove to be a threat if underestimated.</p>

<p>When characters make mistakes, either in or outside combat, they will suffer stress. Once players have accumulated too much stress, they may suffer temporary afflictions with specific effects, forcing them to rethink their strategy. Stress and afflictions are likely to stay with a character during an adventure, raising the stakes until the moment of truth.</p>

<p>Finally, once the characters have overcome their trials and tribulations, they may Forge a Legend! Each legendary item is uniquely created by the players to commemorate the legendary deed that earned it. More than anything, Forge of Legends rewards players for creating outstanding and memorable experiences for everyone involved!</p>

<p>After reading these basic concepts, players should understand how most of the important game rules work and be ready to start making a character. It is highly recommended for the gamemaster (often called the GM) to read through the entire book to gain a firmer grasp of the rules and better guide the players. All these rules are covered in more detail in the rest of the book.</p>

<p>Forge of legends uses multi-sided dice. These include 4-sided dice, called d4, 6-sided dice, called d6, and 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice called d8, d10, d12, and d20, respectively. Ten-sided dice (d10) are the most used, and it is recommended for players to have 3-4 such dice of different colors.</p>

<h2 id="fate">Fate</h2>

<p>In Forge of Legends, fate is on the side of the heroes. Fate is a resource that can be acquired and spent by players to add details to the game world. When a player uses a twist of fate to add a detail to the world, the GM will assign it a fate point cost based on how likely it is that detail exists. If the player agrees to pay that cost, their detail is added to the game world.</p>

<p>Alongside most other rolls in the game, fate dice will also be rolled. When fate dice roll high enough, players may invoke a twist of fate adding a detail to the game world costing fewer fate points. However, when the fate dice roll low, doom may befall the players.</p>

<p>The doom pool is a system used by the GM to structure adventures and provide meaningful setbacks. The GM can use doom in many ways, but all of them serve to put pressure on the players to complete the adventure swiftly.</p>

<p>Since talent rolls, influence rolls, and fate rolls all use 10-sided dice, it would be wise to roll dice of different colors, such as black or white for talent or influence rolls, and colorful dice for fate rolls.</p>

<h2 id="boons--banes">Boons &amp; Banes</h2>

<p>A wide variety of advantages, disadvantages, expertise, and circumstances can affect a character’s odds for success. Boons and banes serve to represent all those considerations.</p>

<p>Any talent roll, influence roll, or attack action gains +2 for each boon associated with it. Additionally, another fate die is rolled for each boon, making fate more likely to intervene and doom more rare.</p>

<p>Conversely, a roll with banes subtracts -2 from those numbers. A roll with banes rolls multiple fate dice, but each can only make the roll more doomed. Boon and banes cancel each other out.</p>

<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>

<p>There are four things every character needs to begin the game: an ancestry, describing the character’s heritage, talents, describing their natural strengths and weaknesses, personality, representing how they view and interact with the world, and a class, which grants most of their abilities.</p>

<h3 id="ancestry">Ancestry</h3>

<p>A character’s ancestry describes their heritage and special abilities granted as a result. There are five ancestries in forge of legends: human, elf, dwarf, gnome, and orc.</p>

<p>A character may have only one ancestry, in which case they may choose three of that ancestry’s abilities to add to their repertoire. Alternatively, a character can be of mixed ancestry. Such a character can chose one ancestry ability from each of their two parents’ ancestries, alongside the adaptable ability.</p>

<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>

<p>Talents represent a character’s innate strengths and weaknesses. There are three talents: agility, which lets a character sneak around and deliver deadly attacks, brawn, which helps with physical feats of strength and going toe-to-toe in melee, and cunning which helps a character spot hidden details and deliver specialized attacks from afar.</p>

<p>When making a character each player will assign seven talents points to each of the three talents in a way that best represents the character they want to play. Each talent may be given between zero and five talent points, with zero being below average and five being extraordinary. Talents cannot be changed, so players should make this decision carefully.</p>

<p>Talent rolls are made using a single 10-sided die, called the chance die, and adding the character’s relevant talent. The character’s background or other circumstances might give the character some boons, each adding +2 to the roll. Making a talent roll also means rolling the fate dice, including adjustments for any boons or banes.</p>

<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>

<p>A character’s personality represents their motives, values, past experiences, and how they interact with other characters. To begin playing, a character only needs personality traits. Personality traits come in three opposing pairs: bold vs subtle, idealistic vs pragmatic, and serious vs carefree. Each trait may be assigned a rating of up to three, but a character can only have one trait from each opposing pair at a time. A character may also assign one of the pairs a rating of zero, meaning they don’t associate with either trait strongly.</p>

<p>These personality traits affect a character’s response to fateful deeds, either awarding them fate if they share the trait or stress if they have the opposite. A character’s personality traits can slowly change over time.</p>

<p>Personality traits are also used to determine the outcome of influence rolls to interact with NPCs. Like talent rolls, influence rolls are made using the chance die and the fate dice. The GM will assign the interaction a personality trait that best described it. Bribing someone might be pragmatic, intimidating someone might be bold, and so on. The character will add their trait rating to the roll if it matches, or subtract it if they have the opposite trait.</p>

<p>Players may also consider their character’s background details, which help with both talent and influence rolls, as well as determining what lore a character knows. Indulgences can help relieve stress, and a character’s personal legend gives them some unique power. However, background details, indulgences, and personal legends may all be decided during play; they don’t need to be set right away.</p>

<h3 id="class">Class</h3>

<p>The last and often most important detail a character needs is the class. A character’s class determines what abilities, they have to help them solve problems in the game world. All classes give characters unique exploration abilities that can help overcome challenges out of combat, as well as a core feature and special abilities used to defeat foes in combat. The Classes chapter below includes a summary of each of the 20 classes.</p>

<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>

<p>Once players have selected their ancestry, talents, personality traits, and class, they are ready to begin playing! At the most fundamental level, playing forge of legends is quite simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The GM describes the scene and any relevant information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The players say what their characters try to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GM decides which if any rules apply and tells the player their odds of success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The player character may attempt the chosen activity, rolling dice to determine the result if necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gamemaster describes the outcomes and consequences of the players’ actions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Players can cooperate to attempt to do anything they can think of in the game world, but they will often be offered a quest or goal by the GM. These goals will often take players to exotic and dangerous locales, where they must defeat fearsome enemies to save the day. However, players are encouraged to look for unorthodox and creative solutions to problems, that’s the stuff that legends are made of!</p>

<p>Overcoming these challenges will reward players with experience, which can be used to unlock new abilities. Players may also acquire new weapons and equipment that give them new ways to solve problems.</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>

<p>During combat, players and enemies controlled by the GM take turns using abilities until one side gives up the fight or is defeated. On each character’s turn, they may use one action, one maneuver, and any reactions or passive abilities that apply.</p>

<p>Vigor is the most important concept in winning a combat. For players, vigor is the combination of their poise, momentum, and focus. These are resource pools that represent the character’s current fighting condition. A character is defeated when all these pools are reduced to zero.</p>

<p>Characters can make attacks with abilities that come from their weapons or their class. A character targeted by an attack must choose, either they take damage equal to the attack’s threat, or they must yield to the attack and suffer its yield. An attack’s threat is a high but fixed number that lets the target choose which vigor pool is damaged. While an attacks yield is often unpredictable and imposes conditions or other negative effects.</p>

<p>Both attack and support actions often call for the fate dice to be rolled alongside them. This can result in powerful fated effects, but also unfortunate doomed effects. Conditions can be applied to characters, and Special Terrain may add effects to the battlefield itself.</p>

<p>All classes and weapons and equipment have different abilities. Character should carefully consider which to add to their limited fighting style.</p>

<h2 id="stress--affliction">Stress &amp; Affliction</h2>

<p>Being defeated in combat, environmental hazards, and distressing experiences can all increase a character’s stress. For each five points of stress a character suffers, they acquire an affliction, a temporary penalty to certain kinds of activities. Characters with afflictions will often need to rethink their strategy.</p>

<p>Stress can accumulate quickly when heroes risk their live against great odds, and only heals slowly when surrounded by safety and comfort. Characters must manage their stress carefully if they want to avoid afflictions, unconsciousness, and even death.</p>

<h2 id="forging-a-legend">Forging a Legend</h2>

<p>The ultimate goal of this game is to Forge a Legend! A legendary deed is earned when players defeat legendary foes, succeed at legendary talent or influence rolls, or otherwise create outstanding and memorable experiences at the table.</p>

<p>Once a legend has been earned, the players and the GM all collaborate to decide exactly how the legend will be remember and what special powers it will have. Once everyone agrees, then the characters may create a completely unique legendary item that commemorates the deed that earned it.</p>

<p>Characters may also undertake legendary quests to create items of their choosing. And each character’s personal legend may grow and evolve as they play. Heroes are remembered, but legends never die.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-game-isnt">What the Game Isn’t</h2>

<p>Forge of Legends shares many features in common with other tabletop roleplaying games. However, experienced gamers may have some expectations that don’t apply to this game in specific.</p>

<p>For one, characters don’t get much more powerful as they gain experience. A character’s talents almost never increase, and neither does their vigor. Instead, most of a character’s progression comes from gaining more options, not more power. Think of this game like a collectable card game, where you can always get more cards, but you can only use so many at a time, and none is stronger by design.</p>

<p>While characters have different talents, all characters are intelligent and admirable in their own way. Some character’s might have more “book smarts” while others have more “street smarts,” but every character knows something the others don’t. While a flamboyant bard might fit in at the king’s court, an orcish war chief might have more respect for the strong silent type.</p>

<p>In terms of combat, no attack simply “misses” its target. While is possible for an attack’s damage to be reduced to zero, any other effects of the attack still occur. Abilities in combat will almost always do something.</p>

<p>Lastly, Forge of legends is a cooperative game. Some groups may enjoy a friendly rivalry, and players may even test their mettle against one another in a duel if both agree (and only if both agree!). But in the end, all the players are working together to achieve their goal.</p>
