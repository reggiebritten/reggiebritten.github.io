<h2 id="inventory">Inventory</h2>

<p>Your inventory describes everything you might be carrying, including weapons, armor, tools, food, water, torches, ammunition, a bedroll, and a backpack to carry it all. Every item has two important attributes, its <strong>bulk</strong>, describing how heavy and awkward it is to carry, and its <strong>price</strong> describing how valuable it is.</p>

<h3 id="bulk">Bulk</h3>

<p>Bulk is an abstract description of how heavy an item is and how hard it is to carry, some items like a lead ball might be bulky simply because of how heavy they are, while others like a 10-foot pole might be bulky because there are awkward to store.</p>

<p>In general, one bulk equates to about five pounds or two and a half kilograms. Your <a href="carrying-capacity.md">carrying-capacity</a> is terms of bulk is equal to five plus three times your brawn, so a character with two brawn could carry 11 bulk, about 55 pounds or just under 25 kg. You can carry up to double this amount, but while you do, you become <a href="...html#conditions\encumbered">encumbered</a>. You can’t reliably carry more than double your carrying capacity over long distances. Over short distances, the GM will call for a brawn <a href="...html#rolls">rolls</a> to see if you can move heavy objects.</p>

<p>Items that weight less that one bulk don’t typically need to be counted against the limit you can carry. If you try to carry many small items, the GM may say that several of those small items make up one bulk.</p>

<h3 id="price">Price</h3>

<p>An item’s price is described as either <strong>copper</strong>, <strong>silver</strong>, <strong>gold</strong>, <strong>platinum</strong>, or <strong>gemstones</strong>. You might buy or sell an item for 1-10 of its type of currency. This range reflects the fact that the price of an item may vary. Several factors-  local availability, demand, or regulations - can influence the price an item will actually cost. Extreme surplus or shortage might even shift an item’s price category. Merchants will usually buy items from you at the lower end of the price range. Legendary items have no standard price, they can be sold for whatever people are willing to pay.</p>

<h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>

<p>In the fantasy world of Forge of Legends, most people buy and sell things using coins of copper, silver or gold. More expensive transactions might be conducted with platinum or even precious gemstones. Land, art, and other property may be traded, but aren’t considered money. Each denomination of coin is worth 10 times as much as the previous denomination, as shown in the table below. Each coin or gem weighs 1/50th of a pound (1/100th kg), so 250 make up one bulk.</p>

<h3 id="supplies">Supplies</h3>

<p>Supplies represent everything an adventurer might use up on a regular basis. This includes food, torches, ammunition, flint and tinder for starting fires, as well as tools for cleaning and maintaining weapons and equipment.</p>

<p>In Forge of Legends, all of those mundane consumables are described by a single item simply called supplies. As long as you have at least one supply, you have everything they need to keep adventuring for the day.</p>

<p>Supplies are priced in silver and take up one bulk. Almost every civilization will have basic supplies, so you should stock up while you are in town. Each evening before you rest, remove one supply from your inventory, representing the resources used throughout the day. If you stay at a inn, your house or, somewhere else were accommodations are provided, you don’t need to use up your supplies. Supplies go expire of the course of weeks, so you shouldn’t need to keep track of their spoilage.</p>

<p>Supplies notably don’t include water. In most parts of the world, water is easy to come by. But in places where water is scarce, you should consider bringing you own. One day’s quantity of water for a person, including a typical container, takes up one bulk.</p>

<p>When you run out of supplies, you may begin to suffer from hunger and accumulate <a href="...html#stress">stress</a>, you may be unable to use weapons requiring ammunition, including bows and guns, and you may struggle to find their way through darkness.</p>
