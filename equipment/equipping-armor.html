<h2 id="equipping-armor">Equipping Armor</h2>

<p>Helmets, pauldrons, breastplates and greaves can all grant you <a href="...html#abilities\armor">abilities/armor</a>, which reduces the damage you take from enemy attacks. However, you should only equip as much armor as you have <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">abilities/brawn</a>. You can equip more armor if you want, but you become <a href="...html#conditions\encumbered">conditions/encumbered</a> until you take off the excess.</p>
