<h2 id="elixirs">Elixirs</h2>
<p>Elixirs are alchemical concoctions that can be used for a wide variety of temporary benefits. Each elixir must be started with a <strong>flask of alkahest</strong>, which can be purchased from most alchemists for the price of a few <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#currency">gold</a>. You may continually add <strong>ingredients</strong> to such as flask, and each ingredient infuses the elixir with one of 10 elemental essences: <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#fire">fire</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#water">water</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#earth">earth</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#air">air</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ice">ice</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#lightning">lightning</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#caustic">caustic</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#mental">mental</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#holy">holy</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#unholy">unholy</a>. Elixirs may be composed of one, two or three ingredients with different essences, and the number of ingredients determines their effects. <br />
Single and double ingredient elixirs can be used in one of four ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may drink the elixir as a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a>. Drinking a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#fire">fire</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#lightning">lightning</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#mental">mental</a> elixir removes the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a> condition from you and grants you +4 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>. Drinking a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#water">water</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#air">air</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#caustic">caustic</a> elixir removes the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a> condition from you and grants you +4 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>. Drinking an <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#earth">earth</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ice">ice</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#holy">holy</a>, or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#unholy">unholy</a> elixir removes the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a> condition from you and grants you +4 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>. Drinking an elixir with two ingredients grants both effects, resulting in +8 defense in total.</li>
  <li>You may carefully coat your weapon with the elixir as an action. Doing so grants your skills with that weapon the tag(s) of the elixir’s ingredient(s) for one minute. For example, a fire elixir would grant your weapon’s skill the fire tag.</li>
  <li>You may carefully coat your armor with the elixir as an action. Doing so grants you <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#resistant">resistance</a> to the tag(s) of the elixir’s ingredient(s) for one minute. For example, a fire elixir would grant you resistance to the fire tag.</li>
  <li>You may throw the elixir at an enemy as a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#standard">standard</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#thrown">thrown</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ranged">ranged</a>:10 <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a> with 8 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> per ingredient. If the target yields, no dice are rolled but you automatically affect the target with one <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#cunning-effects">cunning effect</a> of each of the elixir’s tags. For example, a fire elixir would let you either inflict <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#burning">burning</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#blinded">blinded</a> on the target. <br />
Elixirs with three ingredients transform into something else entirely. All combinations of three unique ingredient essences have completely different and unique effects. Explore the world and experiment with ingredients to discover all 120 elixirs!</li>
