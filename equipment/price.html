<h3 id="price">Price</h3>

<p>An item’s price is described as either <strong>copper</strong>, <strong>silver</strong>, <strong>gold</strong>, <strong>platinum</strong>, or <strong>gemstones</strong>. You might buy or sell an item for 1-10 of its type of currency. This range reflects the fact that the price of an item may vary. Several factors-  local availability, demand, or regulations - can influence the price an item will actually cost. Extreme surplus or shortage might even shift an item’s price category. Merchants will usually buy items from you at the lower end of the price range. Legendary items have no standard price, they can be sold for whatever people are willing to pay.</p>
