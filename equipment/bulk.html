<h3 id="bulk">Bulk</h3>

<p>Bulk is an abstract description of how heavy an item is and how hard it is to carry, some items like a lead ball might be bulky simply because of how heavy they are, while others like a 10-foot pole might be bulky because there are awkward to store.</p>

<p>In general, one bulk equates to about five pounds or two and a half kilograms. The amount of bulk you can carry is equal to five plus three times your brawn, so a character with two brawn could carry 11 bulk, about 55 pounds or just under 25 kg. You can carry up to double this amount, but while you do, you become <a href="conditions.html#encumbered">encumbered</a>. You can’t reliably carry more than double your carrying capacity over long distances. Over short distances, the GM will call for a <a href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> <a href="rolls.html">roll</a> to see if you can move heavy objects.</p>

<p>Items that weight less that one bulk don’t typically need to be counted against the limit you can carry. If you try to carry many small items, the GM may say that several of those small items make up one bulk.</p>
