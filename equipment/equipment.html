					<h1 id="equipment">Equipment</h1>

<p>Whether it is a character’s armor, specialized equipment that grants unique abilities, useful tools like a 10-foot pole, or simply the supplies needed to survive, having the right items can make the difference between success and failure.</p>

<h2 id="equipment-slots">Equipment Slots</h2>

<p>The number and type of items a character can equip is limited by their equipment slots. A character benefits from all their equipped items and, can change their equipment by adjusting their fighting style, as described above. A character wearing too many pieces of equipment in the same slot can’t benefit from any of them properly. A character wearing more armor than their brawn allows suffers the encumbered condition.</p>
<h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>

<p>A character can equip four “hands” of weapons, meaning four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and one two-handed weapon, or two two-handed weapons. Weapons can range from sword to bows to shield to magic wands. For a complete list of weapons and their associated abilities, see the Weapon List chapter below.</p>

<h3 id="head">Head</h3>

<p>Helmets, hats, headbands, and goggles are all considered head equipment. Head equipment often make the biggest impression, as described below. Head equipment is also useful for granting and protecting a character’s sight and hearing.</p>

<h3 id="shoulder">Shoulder</h3>

<p>Cloaks, backpacks, scarves, and pauldrons can all be equipped to a character’s shoulder slot. Such items can have a wide variety of effects, from protecting against the elements, to resisting conditions, to making a dramatic impression.</p>

<h3 id="chest">Chest</h3>

<p>The most common chest equipment is a suit of armor, which increases the character’s armor number and protects against attacks. Many suits of armor cover other parts of the body, but they are still considered chest slot equipment.</p>

<h3 id="feet">Feet</h3>

<p>Boots, shoes, and sandals will often affect how a character moves or interacts with special terrain. A good pair of boots might also help with a long overland journey.</p>

<h3 id="accessories">Accessories</h3>

<p>A character can equip two accessories, such, such as rings, gloves, belts, bracers, or pendants. Such items are rarely useful in combat unless they are legendary, but they may have effects relating exploration, talent rolls, or influence rolls.</p>

<h3 id="pockets">Pockets</h3>

<p>Pockets are unique in that a character doesn’t default have any pocket slots. Instead, pocket slots are often granted by other equipment and characters may have multiple. Items small enough to fit in a pocket slot could be anything from a small knife to a consumable potion.</p>

<h2 id="impression">Impression</h2>

<p>What a person wears can say a lot about them, whether they want it to or not. In addition to an equipment’s slot, many pieces of equipment also have an impression, describing how others perceive that equipment. Equipment impression is described in the same terms as the six personality traits (bold, subtle, idealistic, pragmatic, serious, &amp; carefree), including a rating. However, there are some important differences.</p>

<p>For one, equipment’s impression doesn’t change the person wearing it, only how they are perceived. Impressions only affect influence rolls, not legendary deeds or any other effects based on personality. The equipment an NPC is wearing also doesn’t affect how they will respond to influence rolls made by the player character or other NPCs.</p>

<p>Secondly, while a character’s equipment may have many different impression ratings, only the highest impression rating matters, and influence rolls are only altered by one point at the most. Characters should add together all impression ratings from their equipment. Impression ratings associated with opposite traits cancel out and are subtracted from each other when determining the overall highest.</p>

<p>Whichever impression rating is highest across the character’s equipment is the overall impression their appearance makes. Whenever the character makes an influence roll, their personality is treated as if it that trait rating was one point higher (possibly higher than three), or the opposing trait was one point lower. If multiple impression ratings are tied for the highest, then the character’s equipment doesn’t make a strong impression and their influence rolls are not modified.</p>

<h2 id="inventory">Inventory</h2>

<p>A character’s inventory describes everything else they might be carrying, including food, water, torches, weapon ammunition, a bedroll, and a backpack to carry it all. Any item has two important attributes, its bulk, describing how heavy and ungainly it is to carry, and its price describing how expensive it is.</p>

<h3 id="bulk">Bulk</h3>

<p>Bulk is an abstract description of how heavy an item is and how hard it is to carry, some items like a lead ball might be bulky simply because of how heavy they are, while others like a 10-foot pole might be bulky because there are awkward to store.
In general, one bulk equates to about five pounds or two and a half kilograms. A character’s carrying capacity is terms of bulk is equal to four plus double their brawn, so a character with two brawn could carry eight bulk, about 40 pounds or 20 kg. A character may attempt to carry up to double that amount, but doing so imposes the encumbered condition on the character. A character can’t reliably carry more than double their carrying capacity over long distances. Over short distances, see the rules for lifting and dragging below.
Items that weight less that one bulk don’t typically need to be counted against the limit a character can carry. If a character tries to carry many small items, the GM may say that several of those small items make up one bulk.</p>

<h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>

<p>In the fantasy world of Forge of Legends, most people buy and sell things using coins of copper, silver or gold. More expensive transactions may instead require entire bars of precious metal. Gemstones, land, or other property may be traded, but aren’t considered money.
| Currency  Exchance Rates |              |              |            |             |             |           |
| ———————— | ———— | ———— | ———- | ———– | ———– | ——— |
| Currency                 | Copper Coins | Silver Coins | Gold Coins | Copper Bars | Silver Bars | Gold Bars |
| Copper Coins             | 1            | 1/10         | 1/100      | 1/1,000     | 10,000      | 1/100,000 |
| Silver Coins             | 10           | 1            | 1/10       | 1/100       | 1/1,000     | 10,000    |
| Gold Coins               | 100          | 10           | 1          | 1/10        | 1/100       | 1/1,000   |
| Copper Bars              | 1,000        | 100          | 10         | 1           | 1/10        | 1/100     |
| Silver Bars              | 10,000       | 1,000        | 100        | 10          | 1           | 1/10      |
| Gold Bars                | 100,000      | 10,000       | 1,000      | 100         | 10          | 1         |</p>

<p>Each denomination of coin is worth 10 times as much as the previous denomination. A copper bar is worth 10 times as much as gold coin, and silver and gold are each 10 times more valuable again than the previous denomination. These exchange rates are shown in the table below. Copper coins, silver coins, and gold coins are often called copper, silver, or gold for short. Something only refers to a “bar” if the word is used, otherwise coins are the default.</p>

<p>All coins weigh 1/50th of a pound (1/100th kg), while each bar weighs 20 pounds (10 kg). Players don’t typically need to track the weight of coins they are carrying, but each bar takes up four bulk.</p>

<p>Of course, merchants will usually accept any combination of coins and bars that meet the price required to pay for an item. Most people would rather receive 50 gold coins than 5 copper bars.</p>

<h3 id="price">Price</h3>

<p>An item’s price describes how much someone would typically pay for it. Prices are listed only in terms of their general category - Copper, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Gemstones.</p>

<p>The price of an item describes how much that item is typically worth. Prices are listed in vague ranges of “a few” or “several” of each of the different kinds of currency. For example, a meal at an inn might cost “a few copper (coins),” a good set of clothes might cost “several silver (coins)”, and a sailing ship might cost “a few gold bars.”</p>

<p>These vague terms reflect the fact that the price of an item may vary. Several factors, such as local availability, demand, or regulations, can influence the price an item will actually cost. An item that costs “a few” coins or bars might cost between one and five, while an item that costs “several” coins or bars would cost between six to ten. Extreme surplus or shortage might even shift an item’s price category.</p>

<p>When a player asks the price of an item, The GM may take the opportunity to set the price in the low or high range of the price category in a way the represents the local availability and values. Alternatively, the GM may simply say that any item that costs “a few” costs three, while any item that costs “several” costs seven.</p>

<p>When a character wants to sell an item from their inventory, it will almost always sell at the bottom of the item’s price range; only one or two for “a few,” and six or seven for “several”. Legendary items have no standard price, they can be sold for whatever people are willing to pay.</p>

<h3 id="supplies">Supplies</h3>

<p>Supplies represent everything an adventurer might use up on a regular basis. This includes food, torches, ammunition, flint and tinder for starting fires, as well as tools for cleaning and maintaining weapons and equipment.</p>

<p>In Forge of Legends, all of those mundane consumables are described by a single item simply called supplies. As long as a character has at least one supply, they have everything they need to keep adventuring for the day.</p>

<p>Supplies cost a few silver and take up one bulk. Characters should stock up on as many supplies as they want to carry while they are in town. Each evening before they rest, characters must remove one supply from their inventory, representing the resources used throughout the day. If a character spends a relaxing day in civilization, they may not need to consume supplies if they purchase food and accommodations.</p>

<p>Supplies notably don’t include water. In most parts of the world, water is easy to come by. But in places where water is scarce, adventurers should consider bringing their own. One day’s quantity of water for a person, including a typical container, takes up one bulk.</p>

<p>When character’s run out of supplies, they may begin to suffer from hunger (see the Stress &amp; Affliction chapter below), they may be unable to use weapons requiring ammunition, including bows and guns, they may struggle to find their way through darkness, and they may be unable to repair damaged equipment.</p>

<p>Pockets may be used either to carry one pocket slot item, or to carry an item with a bulk of one.</p>

<p>When a character’s supplies are depleted to one, they are running low on something. The GM may decide weaher they are running low on food, ammo, or tools to maintain their equipment. A character running low on food begins to accumulate stress at a rate of</p>

<p>A character running low on maintaince tools has their actions and ability rolls become doomed on a roll 1 higher, typically when the die rolls either 1 or 2 instead of just one</p>

<h2 id="item-tags">Item Tags</h2>

<h3 id="one-handed">One-Handed</h3>

<p>A one-hand weapon only requires one hand to use properly. Characters can wield two one-handed weapons at once, and equip up to four in their fighting style.</p>

<h3 id="two-handed">Two-Handed</h3>

<p>A two-hand weapon requires both hands to use properly. Characters may only wield one two-handed weapon at a time, and can equip two two-handed weapons in their fighting style. A character may carry a two-handed weapon in just one hand, but cannot use any of the weapons skills while doing do.</p>

<h3 id="zoc">ZoC</h3>

<p>A ZoC weapon is typically used for close combat and grants the character wielding it a zone of control. Zones of control are useful for hindering enemy maneuvers and surrounding them. Note that some situations may prevent a character from having a zone of control even while they wield a ZoC weapon.</p>

<h3 id="reloading">Reloading</h3>

<p>A reloading weapon needs to be reloaded after using a ranged skill. Whenever one of the weapons ranged skills is used, it becomes unloaded, and it can’t use any ranged skills while it is unloaded. The weapon may still be used for non-ranged skills even while unloaded.</p>

<p>All reloading weapons come with the basic reload skill, which may be used to reload the weapon. Additionally, while a character has a reloading weapon equipped in their fighting style, they may also equip one reloading skill as a bonus skill.</p>

<h3 id="damaged">Damaged</h3>

<p>A damaged item is not functioning properly. It imposes a bane on any skills or ability rolls associated with the it. Equipment that normally grants armor grants one fewer point of armor while damaged. Damaged items may be repaired during a 10-minute rest.</p>
