<h3 id="supplies">Supplies</h3>

<p>Supplies represent everything an adventurer might use up on a regular basis. This includes food, torches, ammunition, flint and tinder for starting fires, as well as tools for cleaning and maintaining weapons and equipment. In Forge of Legends, all of those mundane consumables are described by a single item simply called <strong>supplies</strong>. As long as you have at least one supply, you have everything you need to keep adventuring for the day.</p>

<p>Supplies are <a href="equipment.html#price">priced</a> in <strong>silver</strong> and take up <strong>one</strong> <a href="equipment.html#bulk">bulk</a>. Almost every civilization will have basic supplies, so you should stock up while you are in town. Each evening before you rest, remove one supply from your inventory, representing the resources used throughout the day. If you stay at a inn, your house or, somewhere else were accommodations are provided, you don’t need to use up your supplies. Supplies expire of the course of several weeks, so you shouldn’t usually need to keep track of their spoilage.</p>

<p>Supplies notably don’t include water. In most parts of the world, water is easy to come by. But in places where water is scarce, you should consider bringing you own. One day’s quantity of water for a person, including a typical container, takes up <strong>one</strong> <a href="equipment.html#bulk">bulk</a>.</p>

<p>When you run out of supplies, you may begin to suffer from hunger and accumulate <a href="stress.html">stress</a>, you may be unable to use weapons requiring ammunition, including bows and guns, and you may struggle to find your way through darkness. The GM will tell you what penalties you suffer when you are out of supplies.</p>
