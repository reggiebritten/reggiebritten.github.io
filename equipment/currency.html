<h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>

<p>In the fantasy world of Forge of Legends, most people buy and sell things using coins of copper, silver or gold. More expensive transactions might be conducted with platinum or even precious gemstones. Land, art, and other property may be traded, but arenâ€™t considered money. Each denomination of coin is worth 10 times as much as the previous denomination, as shown in the table below. Each coin or gem weighs 1/50th of a pound (1/100th kg), so 250 make up one bulk.</p>
