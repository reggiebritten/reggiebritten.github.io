<p>Your armor reduces the <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#threat">threat</a> and the <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#yield">yield</a> damage of enemy <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a>. You can comfortably equip an amount of armor equal to your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a>. You can equip more armor if you want, but you become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#encumbered">encumbered</a> until you take off the excess. If one skill would deal damage to more than one of your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defenses">defenses</a>, you may choose which one of your defenses your armor protects.</p>
