Defense describes a character’s ability to continue fighting and defending themselves. For player characters and elite or legendary enemies, defense is the combination of the character’s poise, momentum, and focus.</p>\n<h4 id=\"poise\">Poise</h4>\n\n<p>Poise describes a character’s precise balance and control of their weapons and fighting stance. Skills that spend poise require precise coordination, while skills that gain poise let the character readjust their balance. Taking poise damage means being knocked off balance or being forced into an awkward position, and fighting atop a swaying bridge might cause a character to lose poise.\nA character’s base poise is equal to five plus five times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"agility\" data-path=\"abilities/agility\">agility</a>. When a character’s poise is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reeling\" data-path=\"combat/reeling\">reeling</a>, weakening all their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attacks</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"momentum\">Momentum</h4>\n\n<p>Momentum describes how much physical force a character can put into their movements. A skill that slams down into the ground might cost momentum, while a skill that lets a character surge forward might grant momentum. Effects that slam, push, or buffet a character, like a mace blow or howling winds, might damage or reduce a character’s momentum.\nA character’s base momentum is equal to five plus five times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"brawn\" data-path=\"abilities/brawn\">brawn</a>. When a character’s momentum is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"knocked-down\" data-path=\"combat/knocked-down\">knocked-down</a>, preventing them from moving.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"focus\">Focus</h4>\n\n<p>Focus represents a character’s awareness of themselves, other character in the battle, and the battlefield itself. <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"skill\" data-path=\"skill\">Skills</a> that require intense attention will cost focus, but skills that gain focus only take a fleeting thought. Anything that draws a character’s attention away from the battle will deplete their focus, including an enemy’s projectile or a booming explosion.\nA character’s base focus is equal to five plus five times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"insight\" data-path=\"abilities/insight\">insight</a>. When a character’s focus is reduces to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"confused\" data-path=\"combat/confused\">confused</a>, making them just as likely to target allies as enemies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-defense\">Using Defense</h3>\n\n<p>Under normal circumstances, a character begins combat at their base poise, base momentum, and base focus. A character’s base poise is equal to four plus four times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"agility\" data-path=\"abilities/agility\">agility</a>, their base momentum is equal to four plus four times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"brawn\" data-path=\"abilities/brawn\">brawn</a>, and their base focus is equal to four plus four times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"insight\" data-path=\"abilities/insight\">insight</a>.\nMany skills allow characters to gain defense, and a character may gain defense above their base value. However, practically all of these are noisy, obvious, and threatening to any enemies nearby. Even in the absence of apparent enemies, the GM may add <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"doom\" data-path=\"playing/doom\">doom</a> to the pool if players dally to gain defense in dangerous territory. When the adrenaline of combat fades, typically after about a minute, the characters’ poise momentum and focus return to their base values.\nWhen a character’s poise, momentum, or focus are reduced to zero, typically by enemy attacks, they begin to suffer major setbacks. When a character’s poise is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reeling\" data-path=\"combat/reeling\">reeling</a>. A character who’s momentum is reduced to zero becomes <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"knocked-down\" data-path=\"combat/knocked-down\">knocked-down</a>. And if a character’s focus is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"confused\" data-path=\"combat/confused\">confused</a>.

These personality traits come in three opposing pairs: bold vs. subtle, idealistic vs. pragmatic and serious vs. whimsical.\nEach character has a trait rating from zero to six in each trait. A rating of zero to two means that the character is <strong>opposed</strong> to the trait, while a rating of four to six means that the character is <strong>aligned</strong> with the trait. A rating of exactly three means the character is <strong>neutral</strong>.\nOpposite pairs of traits always add up to exactly 6; whenever one trait is increased, the opposite trait is decreased and vice versa. If a character has a bold rating of 3, they must also be subtle 3; if they are serious 5, they must be whimsical 1. Other than that restriction, players may set their characters’ personality trait ratings to anything they wish when creating their character. But one set, personality traits can only change as the results of fateful deeds, described below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bold--subtle\">Bold / Subtle</h3>\n\n<p>Bold and subtle describe a character’s approach to <strong>overcoming obstacles</strong>. A bold character would <strong>confront</strong> an challenge directly, but a subtle character would <strong>bypass</strong> a direction confrontation. A bold character might see themselves as brave, daring, and straightforward, while they see might subtle characters as cowardly, manipulative, or meek. A subtle character sees themselves as patient, wise and careful, but bold characters as impatient, shortsighted, or reckless.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"idealistic--pragmatic\">Idealistic / Pragmatic</h3>\n\n<p>Idealistic and Pragmatic describe how a character responds to an <strong>unpleasant opportunity</strong>. An idealistic character would <strong>renounce</strong> a beneficial but distasteful opportunity, but a pragmatic character would <strong>exploit</strong> such an opportunity. An idealistic character sees themselves as honorable, fair, and someone who does the right thing, while they might see a pragmatic character as unscrupulous, selfish, or downright evil. A pragmatic character sees themselves as realistic, practical and someone who does what needs to be done, while they might describe an idealistic character as a zealot, a wishful thinker, or gullible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"serious--whimsical\">Serious / Whimsical</h3>\n\n<p>Serious and Whimsical describe how a character responds to <strong>intriguing diversions</strong>. A serious character would <strong>persist</strong> toward their main objective, while a whimsical character would <strong>explore</strong> the new circumstance. A serious character sees themselves as tenacious, decisive, and calm, but might see a whimsical character as unreliable, lazy, or overly excitable. A whimsical character sees themselves as friendly, flexible, and passionate, while they might see a serious character as dour, stubborn, and cold.</p>"},"_id":"YFS99erg6v4p6MCf","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273498208,"modifiedTime":1668273498208,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"874VNILJlZzhay5s"}

The most harrowing of these will cause characters to gain stress, and eventually afflictions. Stress represents the long-term, physical, mental, and emotional burdens that a character endures, and afflictions are the palpable manifestation of that stress.\nThere are many effects which can cause stress, and a scarce few which can relive it. The GM may assign or remove stress as seems appropriate for a given situation, but guidelines are given in the table Source of Stress &amp; Relief. In general, something that inflicts one or two stress would be described as unsettling or uncomfortable, something that inflicts three to five stress would be upsetting or painful, something that inflicts 10 stress would be traumatic and anything that inflicts 20 or more stress would be life-threatening.\nStress tends to accumulate quickly when a character risks their life against great odds. Stress is typically relieved only by time and relaxation, both of which may be in short supply when in a hostile environment. Character’s should only expect their stress to decrease when they are surrounded by safety and civilization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sources-of-stress--relief\">Sources of Stress &amp; Relief</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><strong>Sources of Stress &amp; Relief</strong></th>\n      <th> </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>Event</strong></td>\n      <td><strong>Stress Added or Relieved</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Contact with lava or acid</td>\n      <td>+5 or more per round</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Lack of sleep</td>\n      <td>+1 per hour</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>A terrible storm without shelter</td>\n      <td>+1 per hour</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>A virulent disease or poison</td>\n      <td>+1 per hour</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Dehydration</td>\n      <td>+1 per 2 hours</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Starvation</td>\n      <td>+1 per day</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>A fall form an unsafe height</td>\n      <td>+1d6 per space fallen</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Taking damage while defeated</td>\n      <td>Equal to the damage dealt</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Witnessing a horror</td>\n      <td>+1-3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>The death of a close companion</td>\n      <td>+5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>A good night’s rest in a comfy bed</td>\n      <td>-3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>A rough night’s sleep out in the wild</td>\n      <td>-1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>A gourmet meal</td>\n      <td>-1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Participating in your indulgence</td>\n      <td>-1 or more</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"afflictions\">Afflictions</h2>\n\n<p>Afflictions are palpable effects that impair characters who have accumulated too much stress.  When a character’s stress rises above 10, they immediately suffer their first affliction. When a character’s stress rises above 20, they suffer a second affliction.\nThe specific affliction a character receives is related to the source of the stress that caused it. If the stress was caused by a physical attack or hazard, then the character will likely suffer an injury. If the source of the injury is obvious, such as a spiked floor trap causing a foot injury, the GM may assign that injury. If the nature of the injury is not obvious, such as an injury caused by an enemy’s attack, then the GM may determine an injury at random.\nIf the stress that caused the affliction was from some mental or emotional pain, then the GM may likewise determine which other affliction fits best. If no other affliction makes sense for the source of the stress, then the exhausted affliction may always be applied. A character may gain the same affliction multiple times, in which case the effects stack.\nWhenever a character’s stress total rises above 30, they immediately suffer the unconscious condition, and remain unconscious until their stress falls below 30. Once a character has suffered 40 stress, they have died, and nothing short of a miracle could bring them back.\nWhenever a character’s accumulated stress falls below one of these thresholds, their oldest affliction goes into remission. While an affliction is in remission, the character is in the process of recuperating from it and none of the affliction’s penalties apply. However, if the character’s stress rises to the next multiple of 10 again, the affliction and it’s penalties flare into effect once more. If a character’s stress falls below a multiple of 10 while an affliction is in remission, then that affliction is completely removed and the character’s next-oldest affliction goes into remission as well. When a character stress falls to zero, the all afflictions are completely removed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"affliction-types\">Affliction Types</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"exhausted\">Exhausted</h3>\n\n<p>An exhausted character is running out of the energy needed to perform their best. The character’s base poise, base momentum, and base focus are all reduced by two, to a minimum of one. In addition, the target number is increased by one for all their challenges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"head-injury\">Head Injury</h3>\n\n<p>A character with a head injury has difficulty focusing and recalling information. The character suffers a bane on any actions with a positive or negative focus cost, as well as all insight challenges. The character also can’t contribute toward lore checks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"arm-injury\">Arm Injury</h3>\n\n<p>A character with an arm injury has difficulty putting physical force behind any of their efforts. The character suffers a bane on any actions with a positive or negative momentum cost, as well as all brawn challenges. The character’s carrying capacity is also reduced by four.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"foot-injury\">Foot Injury</h3>\n\n<p>A character with a foot injury has trouble coordinating their movements and moving precisely. The character suffers a bane on any actions with a positive or negative poise cost, as well as all agility challenges. The character’s speed is also decreased by one.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"chest-injury\">Chest Injury</h3>\n\n<p>A character with a chest injury has difficulty catching their breath and exerting themselves. The character suffers a bane on any actions that cost three or more defense. The character also suffers a bane on any challenge that take longer than one turn to complete, as well as any challenges made during a chase.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hand-injury\">Hand Injury</h3>\n\n<p>A character with a hand injury has difficulty holding weapons and manipulating objects. The character immediately drops whatever they are holding in one hand (chosen randomly if appropriate). The character can only wield one one-handed weapon and can’t use their injured hand for anything. Two handed weapons are not dropped but can’t be wielded. The character also suffers a bane on any challenge that requires them to use both hands.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"leg-injury\">Leg Injury</h3>\n\n<p>A character with a leg injury has difficulty moving quickly. The character cannot use a maneuver instead of an action on their turn. The character also suffers a bane on any challenges that require them to move more than one space. A group traveling with a character who has a leg injury travels 5 miles / 8km fewer unless the character can be carried.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <h3 id=\"optional-rule-trauma\">Optional Rule: Trauma</h3>\n\n  <p>The most dire of afflictions may not always heal on their own. If an affliction is traumatic, then it isn’t removed even after the stress associated with it has been healed. A traumatic injury might be permanent damage such as a chopped off hand, while a traumatic mental affliction might represent a deep and unresolved issue. Characters may need to see exotic healing magic or confront their inner demons to resolve their trauma. Forge of Legends is designed to be an optimistic game where nothing can keep the heroes down for long; using trauma regularly is not recommended for most groups. However, it can be used if desired or if there is a need to describe a permanent injury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"furious\">Furious</h3>\n\n<p>A furious is upset at the injustice of the world and intent on doing something about it now. The character suffers a bane on any ranged attack actions and on any challenges made to sneak past foes that ought to be fought. The character also suffers a bane on any subtle or pragmatic challenges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bitter\">Bitter</h3>\n\n<p>A bitter character has had their feelings hurt and has trouble thinking of others. The character suffers a bane on any support action that targets other characters (even if it targets themselves as well). The character cannot entertain their groupmates to help relive stress. The character also suffers a bane on any idealistic or carefree challenges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"insecure\">Insecure</h3>\n\n<p>An insecure character has had their self-confidence shaken and is hesitant to take risks. The character’s action challenge TN is increased by two, up to 10, and the character has difficulty manifesting their personal legend in a way determined by the GM. The character also suffers a bane on any bold or serious challenges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"guilty\">Guilty</h3>\n\n<p>A guilty character feels they should have done things differently in the past, and worries that fate won’t favor them until they earn redemption. The character suffers a bane on any support action that targets themselves (even if it targets others). The character can’t gain fate or invoke a twist of fate, and their challenges can’t be fated. The character also suffers a bane on any challenge made to deceive or harm someone else.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bereaved-wip\">Bereaved [WIP]</h3>\n\n<p>A bereaved character has recently lost someone or something close to them and lacks the drive they once felt. The character suffers a bane on any melee attack actions, and can’t recover stress from friendly entertainment while traveling. The character also suffers a bane on any challenge made to inspire, impress, or uplift others.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"paranoid-wip\">Paranoid [WIP]</h3>\n\n<p>A paranoid character can’t trust anyone, not even their supposed “friends”. The character refuses to be targeted by other characters’ support abilities, and refuses to scout or forage while traveling for fear of what the group is planning while they’re gone. The character also suffers a bane on any challenge that appeals a character’s to trust, whether sincere or deceptive.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <h3 id=\"example-of-play\">Example of Play</h3>\n\n  <p>Ezekiel the paladin uses his lay on hands ability to save the life of an innocent peasant by transferring 22 stress to himself. As a result, he immediately suffers two afflictions. In this case, the GM decides that he is exhausted by the ordeal and furious at the injustice of things, in that order. After a good night’s rest Ezekiel recovers 3 three stress, and his total falls down to 9. His exhaustion goes into remission and he no longer suffers it’s penalties, although he is still furious.\nLater that day during his adventures, Ezekiel suffers four more stress, brining his total to 23. He exhaustion returns, and he once again suffers it’s penalties. After completing the day’s work, Ezekiel decides to return to town for a few days to rest and indulge himself. After the first days, his stress falls to 19 and the exhaustion goes into remission. After several more days, his stress falls to 9; his exhaustion is completely removed and the furious affliction goes into remission. By the end of his rest, his stress is 0 and all his afflictions are gone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n \n</div>"},"_id":"LTUbVB2SumJ2QrNb","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273484165,"modifiedTime":1668273484165,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"AAqqnZmcLQKaVGpg"}

Movement is counted in spaces, where one space is equivalent to about 5 feet or 1½ meters.\nThe most reliable way to get from place to place is the dash maneuver, which allows a character to move 3 spaces plus their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"bonus-speed\" data-path=\"abilities/bonus-speed\">bonus speed</a>. However, using most <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"maneuver\" data-path=\"skills/maneuver\">maneuvers</a>, like dash, in an enemy’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"zone-of-control\" data-path=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone of control</a> carries a risk of being <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"hinder\" data-path=\"combat/hinder\">hindered</a>, as described below. Another movement option available to character is the step maneuver, which lets a character move exactly 1 space. Since it has the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"careful\" data-path=\"skills/careful\">careful</a> tag, it can ’t be hindered. Finally, the sprint reaction lets a character trade <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a> for a burst of speed.\nWhenever a character moves, there are a few rules that must be followed. A character can move freely through another friendly character’s space, but not an enemy’s. A character can’t end their turn in another character’s space; if two characters somehow find themselves in the same space at the end of a turn, the GM will move one of them into an adjacent space.\nA character moving diagonally pays one space of movement the first time they move diagonally on a turn, then two spaces for the next time they move diagonally, repeating that pattern as they continue to move diagonally. A character can’t move diagonally if the movement would cut through an impassable obstacle or a hostile character’s space. Characters must typically finish one skill before starting another; a character can’t move a few spaces with a maneuver, use an <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a>, then finish the rest of the maneuver’s movement.\nA character can use three spaces of movement to do other things relating to movement, like opening or closing a door or mounting a horse, or becoming <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"kneeling\" data-path=\"conditions/kneeling\">kneeling</a>. A character swimming, climbing, or moving into certain types of <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"special-terrain\" data-path=\"special-terrain\">special terrain</a> must spend two movement points to move one space.\nSome effects may reduce a character’s speed to zero. Such a character still benefits from moving spaces specified by a skill, but never adds their speed to the total distance moved. Other effects prevent movement entirely, including preventing moving spaces specified by a skill.</p>"},"_id":"wQ8aPrq6J1sin0Dk","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273484491,"modifiedTime":1668273484491,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"ABGCexDLX8KJw65b"}

{"name":"Home","flags":{"forgeoflegends":{"path":"introduction"}},"pages":[{"name":"Home","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div title=\"Home\">\n\t<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Forge of Legends is a heroic fantasy tabletop roleplaying game best played with three to five players and a game master. Players will create and play as mighty heroes destined for greatness. In a setting designed and orchestrated by the gamemaster, player characters must work together to forage through foreboding forests, delve into dangerous dungeons, and vanquish vicious villains! Every heroic deed is symbolized by a legendary item, ensuring the heroes’ legacy will last for ages!</p>\n\n<p>Forge of Legends features fate as a central mechanic. Fate lets the players add detail to the game world beyond the actions of their characters. But where there is fate, doom is not far behind, nipping at the heels of the players to keep the action moving.</p>\n\n<p>With the help of the GM, the players will create characters from familiar fantasy races and classes, like elves, dwarves, warriors, and wizards. Regardless of class, all characters gain access to powerful skills both in and out of combat.</p>\n\n<p>Each character also has a unique personality, and players are rewarded for embracing their character’s personality through fateful deeds. Every character can leverage their personality to interact with NPCs in different ways; in Forge of Legends, everyone shares the spotlight. Characters each have a personal legend, based on their history, which grants them custom powers and capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Combat in Forge of Legends is deep and strategic. Players must balance three distinct resource pools, and each attack offers the target a choice how they will suffer its effects. A wide variety of fated effects, conditions, and special terrains ensure that every fight is interesting and dynamic.</p>\n\n<p>As characters overcome obstacles and defeat enemies, they can access to new and exciting abilities. However, while this growth gives them additional options, characters must always choose a finite set of abilities for their fighting style. Players will never be bogged down by too many options, and even the lowliest foe can prove to be a threat if underestimated.</p>\n\n<p>When characters make mistakes, either in or outside combat, they will suffer stress. Once players have accumulated too much stress, they may suffer temporary afflictions with specific effects, forcing them to rethink their strategy. Stress and afflictions are likely to stay with a character during an adventure, raising the stakes until the climax.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, once the characters have overcome their trials and tribulations, they may Forge a Legend! Each legendary item is uniquely created by the players to commemorate the legendary deed that earned it. More than anything, Forge of Legends rewards players for creating outstanding and memorable experiences for everyone involved!</p>\n\n<p>After reading these basic concepts, players should understand how most of the important game rules work and be ready to start making a character. It is highly recommended for the gamemaster (often called the GM) to read through the entire rules to better guide the players. All these rules are covered in more detail later on.</p>\n\n<p>Forge of legends uses multi-sided dice. These include 4-sided dice, called d4, 6-sided dice, called d6, and 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice called d8, d10, d12, and d20, respectively. Ten-sided dice (d10) are the most used, and it is recommended for players to have 3-4 such dice in different colors.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-the-game-isnt\">What the Game Isn’t</h2>\n\n<p>Forge of Legends shares many features in common with other tabletop roleplaying games. However, experienced gamers may have some expectations that don’t apply to this game in specific.\nFor one, characters don’t get much more powerful as they gain experience. A character’s talents almost never increase, and neither does their defense. Instead, most of a character’s progression comes from gaining more options, not more power. Think of this game like a collectable card game, where you can always get more cards, but you can only use so many at a time, and none is stronger by design.\nWhile characters have different talents, all characters are intelligent and admirable in their own way. Some character’s might have more “book smarts” while others have more “street smarts,” but every character knows something the others don’t. While a flamboyant bard might fit in at the king’s court, an orcish war chief might have more respect for the strong silent type.\nIn terms of combat, no attack simply “misses” its target. While is possible for an attack’s damage to be reduced to zero, any other effects of the attack still occur. Abilities in combat will almost always do something.\nLastly, Forge of legends is a cooperative game. Some groups may enjoy a friendly rivalry, and players may even test their mettle against one another in a duel if both agree (and only if both agree!). But in the end, all the players are working together to achieve their goal.</p>\n \n</div>"},"_id":"aoTOLuB1zYrd0NHV","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273484055,"modifiedTime":1668273484055,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"BCIT287FGvTzcDQ1"}

These personality traits come in three opposing pairs: bold vs. subtle, idealistic vs. pragmatic and serious vs. whimsical.\nEach character has a trait rating from zero to six in each trait. A rating of zero to two means that the character is <strong>opposed</strong> to the trait, while a rating of four to six means that the character is <strong>aligned</strong> with the trait. A rating of exactly three means the character is <strong>neutral</strong>.\nOpposite pairs of traits always add up to exactly 6; whenever one trait is increased, the opposite trait is decreased and vice versa. If a character has a bold rating of 3, they must also be subtle 3; if they are serious 5, they must be whimsical 1. Other than that restriction, players may set their characters’ personality trait ratings to anything they wish when creating their character. But one set, personality traits can only change as the results of fateful deeds, described below.</p>\n    <h3 id=\"bold--subtle\">Bold / Subtle</h3>\n\n    <p>Bold and subtle describe a character’s approach to <strong>overcoming obstacles</strong>. A bold character would <strong>confront</strong> an challenge directly, but a subtle character would <strong>bypass</strong> a direction confrontation. A bold character might see themselves as brave, daring, and straightforward, while they see might subtle characters as cowardly, manipulative, or meek. A subtle character sees themselves as patient, wise and careful, but bold characters as impatient, shortsighted, or reckless.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"idealistic--pragmatic\">Idealistic / Pragmatic</h3>\n\n    <p>Idealistic and Pragmatic describe how a character responds to an <strong>unpleasant opportunity</strong>. An idealistic character would <strong>renounce</strong> a beneficial but distasteful opportunity, but a pragmatic character would <strong>exploit</strong> such an opportunity. An idealistic character sees themselves as honorable, fair, and someone who does the right thing, while they might see a pragmatic character as unscrupulous, selfish, or downright evil. A pragmatic character sees themselves as realistic, practical and someone who does what needs to be done, while they might describe an idealistic character as a zealot, a wishful thinker, or gullible.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"serious--whimsical\">Serious / Whimsical</h3>\n\n    <p>Serious and Whimsical describe how a character responds to <strong>intriguing diversions</strong>. A serious character would <strong>persist</strong> toward their main objective, while a whimsical character would <strong>explore</strong> the new circumstance. A serious character sees themselves as tenacious, decisive, and calm, but might see a whimsical character as unreliable, lazy, or overly excitable. A whimsical character sees themselves as friendly, flexible, and passionate, while they might see a serious character as dour, stubborn, and cold.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"background-details\">Background Details</h2>\n\n    <p>A character’s background details describe the whole collection of experiences they have had over their life. This could include old and mundane information such as where a character was born and who their family is. But it can also include new and fantastic details such as recent adventures.\nAll these background details may become relevant for challenges and lore checks. If a player believes that one or more of a character’s background details would provide them with valuable insight or experience toward achieving their goal, they should point the connection out to the GM. Even players who are not involved in the roll may point out how another character’s background is helpful in a given situation. The GM may ask the player how that experience is relevant, and if the GM agrees, then then detail aids the character.\nPlayers should write down as much information about their character as they think is relevant, with the GM’s permission. However, it is okay if a player doesn’t have their character’s entire background detailed when the character is first created, because a character’s background can always be embellished.</p>\n    <h3 id=\"embellishing-a-background\">Embellishing a Background</h3>\n\n    <p>At any time, a character may ask to embellish their background by adding more details. This is a kind of twist of fate and follows all the same rules, such as only adding detail and not changing established facts. If the GM agrees that the proposed embellishment is reasonable in the context of the character’s existing background, then the player may spend a point of fate to add the embellishment to their character’s background.\nIn general, embellishing a character’s background is easier if fewer details have already been established, and if the detail being added is consistent with the background details that the character already has. The GM should be more permissive of characters who have few background details already established or few that have aided them on their quest so far. Everyone comes from somewhere, and all characters are entitles to backgrounds that help them achieve their goals.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"flaws--fate\">Flaws &amp; Fate</h3>\n\n    <p>The characters of Forge of Legends are still just people, and often come with their own weakness, foibles, and flaws. But fate smiles upon those who admit their shortcomings. A character’s flaws are background details just like any others. However, whenever a character’s flaws or other background details create a significant problem for the character or group, as determined by the GM, that character gains a point of fate. Characters with interesting flaws or double-edged background details will find more opportunities to be favored by fate.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"indulgences\">Indulgences</h2>\n\n    <p>Indulgences are a character’s favorite activities, experiences, and pastimes. Each character should have three to five indulgences that describe what they like to do in their spare time. Whenever a character participates in one of their indulgences, they are relieved of one point of stress. An especially poignant indulgent experience may remove more than one stress or reward a character with a point of fate, at the GM’s discretion.\nAn indulgence should be a pleasant activity that is difficult, risky, costly, or otherwise rare but enjoyable for the character to do. For example, a sentiment such as “I like drinking a few ales” is not an indulgence, because it is not a rare experience. On the other hand, an indulgence such as “I like to get so drunk I have a hangover the next day” is fine because it comes with a downside.\nIndulgences are only special if they are uncommon, and an old indulgence that becomes commonplace may no longer feel as special as it once did. Likewise, characters may discover new indulgences on their journey.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"personal-legend\">Personal Legend</h2>\n\n    <p>A character’s personal legend is a story and power completely unique to them. A personal legend must include 3 things: An origin, a manifestation, and a mystery. Not all the details of a character’s personal legend need to be established right away. Personal legends can and do change over time. It may even be that a character hasn’t yet discovered their personal legend when the game begins. A character may only discover their personal legend in a moment of crisis.</p>\n    <h3 id=\"origin\">Origin</h3>\n\n    <p>The origin is a brief description of how the character came to acquire or understand their personal legend. It may come from the character’s bloodline, one of their past deeds, or years of dedicated training. However, a personal legend is always tied to a character themselves, not an item that the character possesses.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"manifestation\">Manifestation</h3>\n\n    <p>The manifestation of a personal legend is a supernatural ability or power that the character has, usually in the form of a unique skill. The player should suggest the nature of the manifestation, while the GM should offer the specific effects and limitations. Both the player and the GM should agree on an appropriate manifestation. The GM Guidelines chapter includes additional information for designing manifestation.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"mystery\">Mystery</h3>\n\n    <p>Finally, ever personal legend needs a mystery. There may still be unanswered questions or unresolved conflicts about the origin, the character may not fully understand their manifestation, or there may be questions about the future of the personal legend.\nA mystery is a loose thread that the GM can weave into an adventure. If the GM feels like it is difficult to incorporate a character’s mystery into any adventure, then the GM should work with the player to elaborate that mystery.\nBy their nature, legendary mysteries entice characters to seek their answers. Discovering the resolution to a mystery rewards the character with a new manifestation of their personal legend, which may enhance or even replace their old manifestation.\nResolving a mystery doesn’t just spell the end of one chapter of the character’s personal legend. It also marks the begging of another. Wherever a character discovers the answer to their mystery, that player should work with the GM to decide what new mystery has arisen. A personal legend must always have some unanswered questions.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"fateful-deeds\">Fateful Deeds</h2>\n\n    <p>A fateful deed is an important decision made in the spirit of one of the six personality traits. A fateful deed could be something a character says, does, or even doesn’t do, but it must always be a significant, informed, and voluntary choice by a character.\nWhen considering weather or not a situation should qualify as a fateful deed, the GM should think back to the personality traits: Is there a significant obstacle in the players’ path that might be confronted or avoided? Is there an unpleasant opportunity that might be renounced or exploited? Is there an intriguing diversion that may draw the players’ away from their current course? The GM should attempt to let players know in advance when one of their actions will be considered a fateful deed, but fateful deeds may also be declared in hindsight if applicable. Players should also nominate each other’s actions for fateful deeds, but the GM makes the final decision.\nWhen a choice is declared to be a fateful deed, the GM will specify which of the six personality traits most closely matches the situation. Any character involved in the deed should compare their personality traits to that specified by the GM. But characters who are unaware of or unable to influence the deed are not included.\nIf a character’s traits are <strong>aligned</strong> with the fateful deed, then that character gains one point of fate! The character may also choose to strengthen their beliefs increasing the rating of that personality trait by one (up to six) and reducing the opposite trait by an equal amount.\nIf a character is <strong>opposed</strong> the fateful deed, the character faces a dilemma. The character may admit that their priorities have changed, and shift their trait ratings one in the direction of the fateful deed (decreasing the opposite rating). Alternatively, the character may hold fast to their values, but the dissonance between their deeds and their beliefs causes then two points of stress.\nIf the character is <strong>neutral</strong> toward the trait of the fateful deed, then they may choose to increase that trait rating by one (decreasing the opposite trait), but they do not gain fate or suffer stress.</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n\n      <h3 id=\"optional-rule-focus-for-fateful-deeds\">Optional Rule: Focus for Fateful Deeds</h3>\n\n      <p>Performing a fateful deed aligned to one’s personality can be inspiring and motivating. That resolve may just what is needed to turn the tide of battle. If your group wishes to use this rule, then whenever a character performs a fateful deed matching their personality, that character gains +8 focus.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <h3 id=\"discussions\">Discussions</h3>\n\n    <p>If a group character’s have differing opinion about a fateful deed, they may discuss their views with one another. Each player may roleplay their character’s viewpoint and sincerely advocate for what their character would do. After a character participates in a discussion, they are satisfied that they have spoken up for their beliefs and been shown higher priorities by their companions. If the group eventually comes to a decision to which such a character is <strong>opposed</strong>, the character nonetheless gains a point of fate does not suffer any stress as a result of having participated in the discussion. The heroes of Forge of Legends may have colorful personalities, but they always find a way to put aside their differences to achieve their goals.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"lore-checks\">Lore Checks</h2>\n\n    <p>Lore describes all the knowledge about various subjects a character has collected. When the GM or players ask if the characters have some specific knowledge about a subject, the GM will call for a lore check, and assign a lore rating necessary to reveal the information, based on the table below.\nThe players should review their characters’ backgrounds and point out any background detail that might be relevant to the subject. Each relevant background detail adds one to the group’s lore check on the subject. If one or more characters have multiple similar background details, then only one should be counted to determine the group’s lore check. However, if different characters or different background details can offer different perspectives, then each one should be added to the group’s lore check.\nFinally, the GM compare’s the group’s lore check to the necessary lore rating to reveal the information. If the group passes the check, then the GM reveals the information to them. No dice are rolled to determine what a character knows; either they have enough experience from their backgrounds, or they don’t.\nIf a character or group is revealed to have an insufficient lore rating, there are a few things they could do to increase their knowledge. They may try to seek out a person, book, or other source of information that can help them reach the required rating. Or they may ask to embellish their background to add a detail that would expand their knowledge.\n| Lore  Check Ratings |                    |                                            |\n| ——————- | —————— | —————————————— |\n| Lore Rating         | Description        | Example                                    |\n| 0                   | Common  Sense      | Fire  is hot, water is wet                 |\n| 1                   | Public Information | The personality of the local  governor     |\n| 2                   | Expert  Knowledge  | The  type of herb to treat an illness      |\n| 3                   | Whispered Rumors   | Which of the townsfolk may be a  vampire   |\n| 4                   | Well-kept  Secrets | The  whereabouts of the king’s secret heir |\n| 5                   | Legendary Lore     | How to call upon an elder god              |\n| NA                  | Unknowable         | What  came before the dawn of time         |</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"influence-challenges\">Influence Challenges</h2>\n\n    <p>Player character will often need to persuade NPCs to assist them with their adventures. Sometimes, an NPC is eager and willing to do what they can. But when an NPC or group of NPCs is reluctant to help, influence challenges may change their perspective. The GM will call for an influence challenge when a character attempts to change the mind of an NPC or group of NPCs that is uncooperative. Only NPCs can be affected by influence challenges; players may always decide for themselves how their character thinks and reacts.\nFirst, the DM should consider the NPC or group’s objections; their reasons for being unwilling to cooperate with the request. An objection could be that the NPC wants something in return, they fear the consequences of cooperating, or they just plain don’t like the character. If the NPC has no objections, then they would cooperate and no influence challenge in needed.\nNext the GM should decide the NPC’s patience, representing how long they will listen to the characters before refusing to listen more. For simple interactions with simple NPCs, the NPC might only have one objection and one patience, giving the players just one chance at success or failure. But more intricate and nuanced NPCs might have more. Finally, the GM should decide the NPC’s personality traits or use traits that have already been established. The GM typically won’t reveal an NPCs objections, patience, and personality to the players right away, but the NPC’s words and actions will provide hints during the conversation.\nThe player’s goal with influence rolls are to overcome all the NPC’s objections before they run out of patience. The players should describe what their character says and does to persuade the NPC. Then the GM will decide which personality trait most closely matches the character’s words and actions, and assign the roll a target number. If the NPC</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"changing-patience\">Changing Patience</h3>\n\n    <p>Often when an NPC runs out of patience, that is the end of the conversation. However, character can attempt to increase an NPC’s patience by offering them new information relevant to the conversation.\nFor example, a guard may have run out of patience with the players simply asking to be let past. But if one of the players offers a generous bribe, the guard may be willing to reconsider their proposition. Other new information that may increase an NPC’s patience could include sharing a scandalous rumor, a previously unnoticed benefit for the NPC, or a threat against something important to them. Most importantly, whatever is brought up must be relevant to the conversation and new. If it is irrelevant or if the NPC has already been informed, then their patience does not increase.\nAlong the same lines, an NPC’s patience may decrease if they feel that they have been treated rudely or unfairly, or if they would rather avoid the subject of the conversation. Saying the wrong thing can end a conversation just as surely as a failed influence roll.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"moods-wip\">Moods [WIP]</h3>\n\n    <p>Happy - carefree\nSad-serious\nTempted- pragmatic\nAngry - bold\nDisgusted- idealistic\nUncertain - Subtle</p>\n\n    <p>Goals: Learn personality, learn objection, change mood</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n \n</div>"},"_id":"vjr6ShtMjgt6fkRT","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273484075,"modifiedTime":1668273484075,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"ClOC4DABg8LUwFRq"}

Sometimes, an NPC is eager and willing to do what they can. But when an NPC or group of NPCs is reluctant to help, influence challenges may change their perspective. The GM will call for an influence challenge when a character attempts to change the mind of an NPC or group of NPCs that is uncooperative. Only NPCs can be affected by influence challenges; players may always decide for themselves how their character thinks and reacts.\nFirst, the DM should consider the NPC or group’s objections; their reasons for being unwilling to cooperate with the request. An objection could be that the NPC wants something in return, they fear the consequences of cooperating, or they just plain don’t like the character. If the NPC has no objections, then they would cooperate and no influence challenge in needed.\nNext the GM should decide the NPC’s patience, representing how long they will listen to the characters before refusing to listen more. For simple interactions with simple NPCs, the NPC might only have one objection and one patience, giving the players just one chance at success or failure. But more intricate and nuanced NPCs might have more. Finally, the GM should decide the NPC’s personality traits or use traits that have already been established. The GM typically won’t reveal an NPCs objections, patience, and personality to the players right away, but the NPC’s words and actions will provide hints during the conversation.\nThe player’s goal with influence rolls are to overcome all the NPC’s objections before they run out of patience. The players should describe what their character says and does to persuade the NPC. Then the GM will decide which personality trait most closely matches the character’s words and actions, and assign the roll a target number. If the NPC</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"changing-patience\">Changing Patience</h3>\n\n<p>Often when an NPC runs out of patience, that is the end of the conversation. However, character can attempt to increase an NPC’s patience by offering them new information relevant to the conversation.\nFor example, a guard may have run out of patience with the players simply asking to be let past. But if one of the players offers a generous bribe, the guard may be willing to reconsider their proposition. Other new information that may increase an NPC’s patience could include sharing a scandalous rumor, a previously unnoticed benefit for the NPC, or a threat against something important to them. Most importantly, whatever is brought up must be relevant to the conversation and new. If it is irrelevant or if the NPC has already been informed, then their patience does not increase.\nAlong the same lines, an NPC’s patience may decrease if they feel that they have been treated rudely or unfairly, or if they would rather avoid the subject of the conversation. Saying the wrong thing can end a conversation just as surely as a failed influence roll.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"moods-wip\">Moods [WIP]</h3>\n\n<p>Happy - carefree\nSad-serious\nTempted- pragmatic\nAngry - bold\nDisgusted- idealistic\nUncertain - Subtle</p>\n\n<p>Goals: Learn personality, learn objection, change mood</p>"},"_id":"VdnuDgSDPlr5Un22","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273498186,"modifiedTime":1668273498186,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"GHVVXXr933zAoGPp"}

Most are bad, some are good, and others may be a mix of both depending on a character’s priorities. Many conditions are inflicted during combat, but some arise outside combat as well. Each condition lasts until something happens to end or remove it, and applies a specific set of bonuses or penalties to the affected character. Refer to the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"condition-list\" data-path=\"conditions/condition-list\">Condition List</a> section for a description of each condition’s effects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"removing-conditions\">Removing Conditions</h2>\n\n<p>All conditions, except for those with the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"persistent\" data-path=\"conditions/persistent\">persistent</a> tag, can be removed by using the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; skill. The &lt;a href=\" data-path=\"recovery\">recovery</a> skill. The <a href=\"conditions/blessed\">blessed</a> condition can also help remove non-persistent conditions. Some conditions also specify other requirements which will automatically remove the condition when they are met.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"replacing-conditions\">Replacing Conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Many conditions will be overwritten by specific other conditions when they are applied, in addition to any other effects. For example, if a character who is <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"burning\" data-path=\"conditions/burning\">burning</a> becomes <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"wet\" data-path=\"conditions/wet\">wet</a>, then the burning condition in immediately removed from them. Replacing a condition can even remove persistent conditions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"condition-tags\">Condition Tags</h2>\n\n<p>Just like skills, conditions also have tags that describe how they work and interact with other parts of the game.</p>\n<h3 id=\"persistent\">Persistent</h3>\n\n<p>A persistent condition cannot be removed by typical means, Including the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; skill or the &lt;a href=\" data-path=\"recovery\">recovery</a> skill or the <a href=\"conditions/blessed\">blessed</a> condition.

Elemental conditions also have a skill tag that denotes which specific element they represent. Characters <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"immune\" data-path=\"skills/immune\">immune</a> to the element denoted will typically be immune to the associated elemental condition as well. For example, a character immune to the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"fire\" data-path=\"skills/fire\">fire</a> skill tag will typically be immune to the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"burning\" data-path=\"conditions/burning\">burning</a> elemental condition.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"magical\">magical</h3>\n\n<p>A magical condition is supernatural in origin.

A fateful deed could be something a character says, does, or even doesn’t do, but it must always be a significant, informed, and voluntary choice by a character.\nWhen considering weather or not a situation should qualify as a fateful deed, the GM should think back to the personality traits: Is there a significant obstacle in the players’ path that might be confronted or avoided? Is there an unpleasant opportunity that might be renounced or exploited? Is there an intriguing diversion that may draw the players’ away from their current course? The GM should attempt to let players know in advance when one of their actions will be considered a fateful deed, but fateful deeds may also be declared in hindsight if applicable. Players should also nominate each other’s actions for fateful deeds, but the GM makes the final decision.\nWhen a choice is declared to be a fateful deed, the GM will specify which of the six personality traits most closely matches the situation. Any character involved in the deed should compare their personality traits to that specified by the GM. But characters who are unaware of or unable to influence the deed are not included.\nIf a character’s traits are <strong>aligned</strong> with the fateful deed, then that character gains one point of fate! The character may also choose to strengthen their beliefs increasing the rating of that personality trait by one (up to six) and reducing the opposite trait by an equal amount.\nIf a character is <strong>opposed</strong> the fateful deed, the character faces a dilemma. The character may admit that their priorities have changed, and shift their trait ratings one in the direction of the fateful deed (decreasing the opposite rating). Alternatively, the character may hold fast to their values, but the dissonance between their deeds and their beliefs causes then two points of stress.\nIf the character is <strong>neutral</strong> toward the trait of the fateful deed, then they may choose to increase that trait rating by one (decreasing the opposite trait), but they do not gain fate or suffer stress.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <h3 id=\"optional-rule-focus-for-fateful-deeds\">Optional Rule: Focus for Fateful Deeds</h3>\n\n  <p>Performing a fateful deed aligned to one’s personality can be inspiring and motivating.

A character adds their brawn to the damage of melee attack actions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ranged\">Ranged</h3>\n\n<p>A ranged skill will specify a maximum range, such as “Ranged: 10”. This range is increased by a character’s insight. A ranged skill can target one character within the maximum range.

The character may draw a line in any direction, and the skill targets any space or character that the line passes though, up to the maximum range. Line skills require precision and cannot target a character that cannot be seen; they automatically fail to affect unseen characters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"burst\">Burst</h3>\n\n<p>A burst is a sphere that spreads out from the center a number of spaces specified by the skill. For example, a two-space burst would include the center of the area as well as all spaces up to two spaces away from the center. Bursts cannot normally go through walls, but can spread around them.\nA burst can be <strong>central</strong>, <strong>point-blank</strong>, or <strong>within range</strong>. A central burst means the area of the skill must be directly centered on the character using it If a character occupies more than one space, they choose one of their spaces as the center of the burst. A point-blank burst means that at least one space of the burst must be adjacent to the character using the skill, and no space can include the character. A burst within range means that the center of the burst may be anywhere within the range of the skill. Note that the range applies to the center of the area, so it is possible for a character to be affected even beyond the listed range.</p>"},"_id":"WNbZmwhQfLhjYifZ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273498459,"modifiedTime":1668273498459,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"IrYMXeF9ZA1KzfuT"}

If the source of the injury is obvious, such as a spiked floor trap causing a foot injury, the GM may assign that injury.

Mitigating the attack means directly applying the threat of the attack as damage to the target’s choice of poise, momentum, or focus. In contrast, yielding an attack means accepting the yield of the attack. An attack’s yield often does a random amount of damage to a specific kind of defense (specified by the attack) along with other negative consequences. Mitigating an attack is often more costly than yielding, but it is more reliable, and the defender has more choice in which kind of defense is damaged. \nMitigating with poise is called dodging, mitigating with momentum is called blocking, and mitigating with focus is called predicting. A character can only mitigate an attack if they can take the threat as damage to the chosen pool without the pool being depleted. For example, a character with 8 momentum and 2 armor could block  an attack with 9 threat, but not one with 10 threat. If a character can’t block, dodge or predict an attack, they have no choice but to yield to it.\nEffects of the attack take place regardless of any other decisions of the attacker or the defender. Whether the attack is mitigated or yielded, the effects are usually resolved first (though still after the user spends or gains defense). If the attack is an action, the fate dice will be rolled, which may cause the action to become  <a href=\"combat.md#Fated--Doomed-Actions\"></a>, as described below.\nRegardless of weather they mitigate or yield the attack, the damage dealt by it is reduced by the character’s armor, down to a minimum of 0. Some attacks may deal damage to multiple defense types or from multiple sources. In that case, the defender’s armor should only be applied once to the total damage dealt, not each instance of damage. However, the defender may choose which defense damage their armor prevents. Likewise, the attack may choose which defense damage is boosted by their brawn or insight.\nIf an attack reduces a character poise momentum or focus to zero, excess damage carries over into another defense of the defender’s choice. If all three pools are reduced to zero, that character is defeated and excess damage carries over to the character’s stress.</p>"},"_id":"fifOw8WsjIxfN1pJ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273484248,"modifiedTime":1668273484248,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"LBAE8CmHhrQsgfDP"}

Players might need to hack their way through a tangled jungle, spelunk to the bottom of a dark cave, or climb to the top of a snowy mountain. All these locales can pose serious challenges to unprepared adventurers. At other times, the heroes will need to jump, climb, swim, or sneak, or smash their way into a particular location.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"special-movement\">Special Movement</h2>\n\n<p>Most movement rules assume characters are simply walking or running. But when characters try to jump, climb, swim, or even fly, these special rules may apply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"jumping\">Jumping</h3>\n\n<p>A character can easily jump a number of spaces horizontally equal to one plus their brawn with a running start, or half that distance if they don’t have a running start. A character can jump vertically a number of feet equal to their brawn, or about 1/3rd that many meters. If a character wants to jump farther or higher, the GM will call for a brawn talent roll to see if they succeed or fail.\nA character can jump as part of any movement ability, and spaces moved while jumping count against the total number of spaces they may move. A character who runs out of movement in the middle of their jump may end their turn suspended in the air. On their next turn, the must either use movement to complete the jump or they fall.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"climbing\">Climbing</h3>\n\n<p>Climbing up an easy structure like a ladder typically doesn’t require a talent roll. Climbing up a rope, tree, or cliff usually requires a brawn roll with a target number set by the GM.\nA character can use a movement ability to climb, but they must spend two points of movement for every space they climb. In general, character can’t use actions while climbing, although the GM may make exceptions. A character in the middle of climbing when attacked can’t mitigate the attack, they must suffer the attack’s yield (described in the Combat chapter below).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"falling\">Falling</h3>\n\n<p>When a character is shoved off a ledge or fails at jumping or climbing, they may eventually fall. However, if such a character is near a ledge, rope, or other grabbable surface when they begin to fall, they may immediately grab that surface and be dangling from it instead.</p>\n\n<p>Dangling is still an extremely dangerous position to be in. The character suffers a bane on brawn talent rolls to climb back up, and if they fail such a roll, they fall to the ground below. A character dangling from a ledge during combat is considered knocked-down and will fall if shoved again, and can’t mitigate attacks as if they were climbing.</p>\n\n<p>When a character falls, they suffer stress based on how far they fell. A character can jump down two spaces, or fall accidentally one space, with no consequence. If they fall farther than that, they may suffer up to 1d6 stress for each additional space fallen, and afflictions based on the stress. The falling character may make an agility talent roll to break their fall; for every three points of the roll, the fall is treated as if it was one space shorter.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming\">Swimming</h3>\n\n<p>Characters in Forge of Legends are assumed to be competent swimmers, although a character with a background detail that says otherwise may gain a fate point when required to swim. However, swimming through stormy seas or rushing rapids will often require a brawn talent roll.</p>\n\n<p>A character needs to spend two points of movement for every space they move while swimming. A character in a moving body of water may be carried along with the flow if they don’t swim faster. Several rules apply to fighting in or under water, which are detailed in the Combat chapter below.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flying\">Flying</h3>\n\n<p>Many mythical creatures possess the power of flight. A flying creature must spend two movement points for ever space it ascends, but it gains an additional movement point for every space descended. A flying creature ignores most special terrain.</p>\n\n<p>A flying creature that becomes keeling immediately falls six spaces as well, and a creature that becomes knocked-down falls 12 spaces. They fall that same distance at the end of each of their turns as long as the conditions persist. Any flying creature without the hover ability must to use a movement ability each turn, or it falls six spaces. However, all flying creatures can partially control their fall. If they hit the ground, they treat the fall as if it were half the distance (halved before the one free space for an accidental fall).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"breath-holding\">Breath Holding</h3>\n\n<p>A character who unexpectedly finds themselves plunged under water suffers the choking condition, and the choking condition can’t be removed while they remain underwater. A character may also become choking if they are unexpected immersed in a toxic cloud or buried.</p>\n\n<p>However, a character who intentionally holds their breath on their turn is immune to the choking condition. A character holding their breath in combat loses-2                                 momentum, -2   poise at the end of their turn, down to a minimum of one.</p>\n\n<p>A character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to six plus double their brawn. However, any round in which the character uses an action or two maneuvers counts as three rounds of holding their breath instead of one. When a character’s breath runs out, the suffer 1d6 stress each round until they take a breath.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"light--darkness\">Light &amp; Darkness</h2>\n\n<p>The level of light in an area is described by one of three terms: bright, dim, or dark.</p>\n\n<p>Daylight, torches, and campfires all cast bright light, which imposes no penalties or modifications. An starry night in an open field or the border of a fire may be dim light. All actions used against targets in dim light suffer a bane.</p>\n\n<p>A dark area, such as a the depths of a cave or a midnight forest, is almost completely devoid of light. Most characters can’t see in darkness, meaning they can’t even target other characters with abilities. If a character moves more than one space without being able to see where they are going, they may bump into something, making noise and suffering stress.</p>\n\n<p>All skills are assumed to make a significant amount of noise, whether it’s the clatter of footfalls, grunts of exertion, the clang of steel on steel, the thrum of a bowstring, or arcane words of power. The exception to this rule is a skill that has the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"stealthy\" data-path=\"skills/stealthy\">stealthy</a> tag, which can be used without making a commotion.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hiding--perception\">Hiding &amp; Perception</h2>\n\n<p>When a character wants to hide from another character or a group, there are a few factors to consider. First, a character must have something to hide behind or at least dim light to conceal them; a character can’t hide in plain sight.</p>\n\n<p>To become hiding, a character can use the hide ability, which lets them move a short distance and attempt an agility talent roll. While already hiding, a character can normally move three spaces plus their speed, where each space is about five feet or 1½ meters.</p>\n\n<p>The GM will usually call for an agility roll each time the hiding character moves. However, the GM may also call for only one roll for a large amount of movement, or a roll to remain concealed even when not moving, if appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Weather the agility roll to become hidden passes or fails depends on the perception of the characters they’re trying to hide from. A character’s perception describes their awareness and how difficult they are to sneak up on, and is normally equal to six plus their cunning.</p>\n\n<p>When determining if a character successfully hides from other characters, their agility roll must be higher than the perception of every character that they’re trying to hide from. Hiding from some but not all characters means those who do notice something suspicious will almost always warn their allies.</p>\n\n<p>If the hiding character’s agility roll is successful, they gain the hidden condition and their movements were unnoticed. If your enemies haven’t seen you yet and aren’t engaged in combat, then they are also surprised if you spring from hiding ready to strike! If the roll to hide fails against an alert enemy, then the character was probably noticed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-circumstances\">Other Circumstances</h3>\n\n<p>A character’s perception number assumes the character is vigilant and alert for danger nearby. However, when a character is in friendly territory and not expecting an attack, they will probably be relaxed. A relaxed character’s perception is two points lower than normal. Some conditions can also reduce perception, like unconscious (-6) blinded (-4), deafened (-2), distracted (-2), and drunk (-2).</p>\n\n<p>The first time a character fails an agility roll to hide from or sneak past a relaxed character, that character will become alert. If an NPC has allies nearby, they will probably warn those allies, making them all alert. An alert NPC might move to investigate the area, prepare their defenses, or even start running away. A recently alerted NPC won’t typically be surprised if attacked. When an agility roll to hide fails against an alert character, the hiding character is immediately spotted.</p>\n\n<p>A character sneaking in dim light adds a boon to their agility roll to remain hidden. A character behind cover, in overgrown terrain, in an obscuring cloud, or who is otherwise difficult to spot also gains a boon. A character can only gain one boon from any of these circumstances, even if multiple apply.</p>\n\n<p>A character moving completely out of sight of any possible enemies gains two boons in the roll instead. This includes a character moving through complete darkness, if none of the enemies can see in darkness. However, unless the sneaking character can see in darkness, they also add a bane to their roll, cancelling out the boon.</p>\n\n<p>Using two maneuvers in a turn, using the sprint ability, or otherwise moving quickly imposes a bane on the agility roll. Using an action or an audible ability almost always reveals the hidden character.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"pursuit\">Pursuit</h2>\n\n<p>When faced with an overwhelming enemy, there is often no choice left but to flee. These rules for pursuit should be used when ever one character or group attempts to escape the pursuit of another.</p>\n\n<p>The GM will start by identifying which character or group is the <strong>pursued</strong>, attempting to escape, and who is the <strong>pursuer</strong>, attempting to catch them. If both sides intend to apprehend each other, the rules for combat should probably be used instead. Next, the GM will determine the <strong>gap</strong> between the pursued and the pursuer(s). This gap is the number of spaces between the two along the most obvious path. For example, if characters are 30 feet across a narrow ravine with a bridge 20 feet away, the GM would typically set the gap at 14 spaces; 4 to get to the bridge, 6 to cross it, and another 4 to get to the pursued’s starting location (jumping across would be a <strong>shortcut</strong>, detailed below).</p>\n\n<p>The details of the <strong>pursued,</strong> <strong>pursuer</strong>, and <strong>gap</strong> may depend on the circumstances. For example, if the heroes want to catch just one member of an enemy group to question them, then the GM would likely set the gap as the number of spaces to the nearest enemy. On the other hand, if the heroes want to make sure none of the enemy group escape to warn their accomplices, then GM would likely set the gap as the distance to the furthest enemy. Multiple character starting from different locations may have their own gaps to their pursued targets. The GM may always increase or decrease the gap(s) as such circumstances change.</p>\n\n<p>Once the gap between the pursuer and the pursued is established, the first round of the pursuit begins! Each character makes an <strong>agility</strong> roll; the pursuer subtracts their roll from the gap, while the pursued adds their roll to the gap. Unlike combat, all pursuit rolls and actions are made at the same time.If the remaining gap is zero or less, the pursuer has caught the pursued and may knock them to the ground! If there is a gap remaining at the end of the round, the chase goes on and another round begins.</p>\n\n<p>A character may continue the pursuit for a number of rounds equal to their <strong>brawn</strong>. After that number of rounds, that character runs out of stamina and can no longer keep up. If all of the pursuers run out of stamina, the pursued inevitably escapes; if the pursued runs out of stamina, they are inevitably caught.</p>\n\n<p>On each round of the pursuit, each character may also roll the fate die. If they roll above their fated action threshold, they may invoke a discounted twist of fate as normal.</p>\n\n<p>Quarry gets away if the set an obstacle that the pursuers can’t overcome.</p>\n\n<p>Hiding costs 4/3 gap</p>\n\n<p>obstacle encounter</p>\n\n<p>shortcuts</p>\n\n<p>shortcut is revealed</p>\n\n<p>doom is spent</p>\n\n<p>The pursuers goal is, of course, to catch the pursued. THe pursueds goal, on the other hand, is to <strong>escape</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Getting to a location the pursuers can’t acess, such as rowing away in the lost boat or crossing a rope bridge then cutting it.</p>\n\n<p>Hiding and slipping away unnoticed, such as a slipping unnoticed into the sewer system or mingling with an unsuspecting crowd.</p>\n\n<p>Finding backup or encountering something else that would cause the pursuers to rethink their pursuit.</p>\n\n<p>A character’s skills may also play a role in a pursuit. It is assumed that all characters involved in a chase are using the dash maneuver twice a turn to run as fast as possible, and the bonus speed granted by their agility is represented by the bonus to their agility roll made during the chase. Using other skills risks falling behind in the chase; if a character uses an action or maneuver other than dash, the gap shifts three [placeholder] spaces against them and they can’t add their agility to their pursuit roll that turn. However, the GM may adjust the gap if the skill lets them move or resolve other effects of the skill as appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>These chase rules can also be used when two or more character are all racing to reach a goal before the others.</p>\n\n<p>The pursued might also be an object or a location, such as a runaway wagon or a magical artifact.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"time--doom\">Time &amp; Doom</h2>\n\n<p>Time is not on the side of the heroes. The longer they take to complete an adventure, the more their enemies will be prepared and the greater the chance for disaster.</p>\n\n<p>The GM may describe each location the players visit as safe, wild, dangerous, or deadly. A safe location, such as a respectable city, a well-traveled road, or a peaceful grassland, does not accumulate doom. However, exploring a wild location such as a spooky forest or craggy hills risks attracting unwanted attention. The GM will increase the doom pool by one for each day spent in a wild location.</p>\n\n<p>A dangerous location might be a cursed swamp, a haunted graveyard, or a forgotten ruin. The doom pool will increase by one for every hour of time spend in a dangerous location. Finally, a deadly location, such as an enemy encampment or an evil wizard’s tower, will increase the doom pool for every 10 minutes passed. Heroes should spend no longer than necessary in such locations and return to safety whenever possible.</p>\n\n<p>When time is critical, such as right before a villain’s plans comes to completion, the GM may increase the doom pool even faster, such as every minute or even every round. Other factors can increase doom as well, such as letting an enemy escape to warn its allies or making a loud commotion that might attract attention. Guidelines for using the doom pool can be found in the GM Guidelines chapter below.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"overland-travel\">Overland Travel</h2>\n\n<p>The heroes’ adventures will often take them to far off and exotic locations. To get there will likely take days or even weeks of travel. How long it takes and how much stress the travelers suffer depends mostly on the terrain and the weather, but mounts, vehicles and ships may make the journey easier or faster.\nIn general, travel time is measured in days, where a typical day’s travel consists of about 10 hours walking, 4 hours resting, cooking and camping, and 10 hours sleeping and keeping lookout. However, the GM may present certain challenges, like crossing a dangerous river or descending a steep canyon, as individual encounters separate from the normal day’s travel.\nStress accumulated from terrain or weather is applied to all characters in the group at the end of the day’s travel. If terrain or weather reduces the distance traveled to zero, then no progress is made that day but stress will still accrue. The stress of travel only applies to character actually traveling overland, not characters resting in place. Characters accumulating too much stress may need to stop and rest for a day or two before continuing. Character may also use travel activities and some downtime activities, detailed below, while resting for a day.\nWhether traveling or resting for a day in the wilderness, characters will likely come across one or more encounters. Some of these encounters may be benign, a few may even be beneficial, but many will pose challenges the players must overcome. The larger the doom pool, the worse each encounter is likely to be, as described in the GM Guidelines chapter.\nTraveling through a wild location is likely to increase the doom pool, so characters may prefer to avoid such places if they have the luxury of time. However, when time is scarce, taking the long way around may accrue even more doom.\nThe GM may rule that some abilities can’t be used in certain types of terrain and weather. Water abilities may fail in parched deserts and fire abilities may fizzle in a torrential downpour.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrain\">Terrain</h3>\n\n<p>Terrain is the type of landscape the characters are traveling through, and it has the biggest impact on how far they can travel and how difficult the journey is.\nA list of terrain types, normal travel distance, and stress per day are show in the table below. Woods, shrubland, hills and roads all modify the distance and/or stress of the journey, in addition to whatever terrain type they are a part of. A road can never reduce the stress form traveling below zero.\n| Travel  Time &amp; Stress by Terrain &amp; Weather |                              |                |\n| —————————————— | —————————- | ————– |\n| Terrain / Weather Type                     | Travel Distance (miles / km) | Stress per Day |\n| Plains                                     | 20 / 32                      | 0              |\n| Tundra                                     | 15 / 24                      | 1              |\n| Desert                                     | 20 / 32                      | 2              |\n| Swamp                                      | 10 / 16                      | 2              |\n| Mountains                                  | 5 / 8                        | 2              |\n| Jungle                                     | 5 / 8                        | 3              |\n| Snow &amp; Ice                                 | 5 / 8                        | 3              |\n| Woods or Shrubland                         | -5 / -8                      | 0              |\n| Hills                                      | -5 / -8                      | +1             |\n| Road                                       | +5 / +8                      | -1 (minimum 0) |\n| Clear Weather                              | 0                            | 0              |\n| Foul Weather                               | -5 / -8                      | +1             |\n| Mild Storm                                 | -10 / -16                    | +5             |\n| Severe Storm                               | -25 / -40                    | +1 per hour    |</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"weather\">Weather</h3>\n\n<p>The weather while traveling can have just as much effect as the terrain. The weather is described in one of four terms: clear weather, foul weather, mild storm, and severe storm.</p>\n\n<p>Clear weather is a sunny or cloudy day with no precipitation, it has no effect on travel speed or stress. Foul weather might be light rain or snow, a heat wave, or a cold snap. Foul weather decreases travel distance for the day by five miles and increases the stress for traveling by one.</p>\n\n<p>A mild storm might describe a rainstorm, or a light blizzard or dust storm. Traveling during a mild storm is not recommended, the travel distance is reduced by 10 and characters suffer five stress if they choose to travel that day. Characters who aren’t traveling may even suffer three stress if they can’t manage to find shelter from the storm.</p>\n\n<p>A severe storm is a thunderstorm, hurricane, or an extreme blizzard or dust storm. Travel is impossible, and any character exposed to the elements suffers one stress per hour. Some weather, like tornadoes and supernatural storms, may have even more immediate and dangerous consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Some pieces of equipment like warm or cool clothing can help protect against the weather.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"forced-march\">Forced March</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes, when speed is of the essence, characters can push themselves to travel further than normal. Characters can choose to travel up to double the normal travel distance, however they suffer one stress for each 1/5th of the day’s normal travel distance.</p>\n\n<p>For example, characters may choose to travel up to 30 miles through hilly plains, but they suffer one stress for each three miles traveled beyond the first 15.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mounts\">Mounts</h3>\n\n<p>Mounts, such as horses, make travel easier and more convenient over long distances. A horse or donkey can carry much more bulk than a person.</p>\n\n<p>With proper pack saddles, a donkey can carry 50 bulk, a horse, mule, or camel can carry about 100 bulk,  and an ox can carry 150 bulk, not including a rider. A horse, mule, camel, or ox needs to eat five supplies per day, and a donkey eats one. However, these animals can usually forage for food where grass is plentiful.</p>\n\n<p>Mounts are also more comfortable, a character traveling mounted suffers one less stress per day from traveling through any terrain. However, mounted travel doesn’t protect against the effects of weather. Mounts themselves may become stressed and suffer afflictions if taken to extreme environments or not cared for.</p>\n\n<p>While many mounts are capable sprinters, they aren’t much faster over the course of a day. Even with mounts, a group’s overland speed is limited by terrain according to the above table. If time is of the essence, a mount may cover the entire day’s travel in half the time, but that would be very stressful for the mount and it couldn’t go any further that day.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicles--ships\">Vehicles &amp; Ships</h3>\n\n<p>Wagons, Carriages, and Ships can all make travel more comfortable. A wagon or carriage reduces the stress of both terrain and weather by one per day. They also double the amount that the pack animal pulling them can carry. However, wagons and carriages travel 5 miles    (8 km) per day more slowly even on roads, and 10 miles (16 km) more slowly where there isn’t a road.</p>\n\n<p>Large sailing ships can travel around 100 miles per day, depending on their size and construction. Prevailing winds may increase or decrease this speed depending on their direction. Travel aboard a large ship is not very stressful, even stormy weather may only cause one stress per day. However, a terrible storm may damage the ship itself. A rowboat travels only five miles per day in still water and doesn’t protect against the weather.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-activities\">Travel Activities</h2>\n\n<p>While traveling, heroes can undertake additional activities that help them on their adventure. The three travel activities are scouting, entertaining, and foraging. When beginning travel each day, each character should pick one travel activity to do during the day. Multiple scouts, entertainers, or foragers follow the rules for group rolls described above.</p>\n\n<p>Trailblazing\nHauling\nScouting\nHunting\nGathering\nNagivating\nProvisioning - prevent supply loss by crating, etc\nRelaxing\nUtility - set your own specific priotiry, such as keeping an item safe or decypering directions, managing enviromental hazards like quicksand. Gain a boon on all relevant checks. make a map</p>\n\n<p>Guard? Scare off wild animals / bandits? first into action when dangert arises?</p>\n\n<p>Who remains alert for being followed? Who covers tracks.\nWho finds ruins, campsites, monster signs, etc?</p>\n\n<p>Forecast = predict weather</p>\n\n<p>character roles will dictate where they are if a giht breaks out - trailblazers and scounts will generally lead the way, with navigators close behind. Hunters and foragers will ghenerally be to the side and a little off the beaten path looking for resouirces. Hauler’s provisioners, and relaxers will generally be in the back taking care of or partaking in supplies.</p>\n\n<p>While the navigator helps their group stay on tack (often literally) toward thier goal, a scout looks out for potential dangers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trailblazing\">Trailblazing</h3>\n\n<p>risks stress, speeds travel\nNavigating</p>\n\n<p>Pace - fast, normal slow</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scouting\">Scouting</h3>\n\n<p>slows pace, reduces doom</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tracking\">Tracking</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"navigating--tracking\">Navigating / Tracking</h3>\n\n<p>Staying on path</p>\n\n<p>check to see if you got lost\ndo you have a landmark?\ncan you see it?\nMake table of navigation TNs</p>\n\n<p>A scouting character stays a bit away from the main group to keep a lookout for hazards, enemies, tracks, or to make sure the group doesn’t get lost. If any of those challenges present themselves during the day’s travel, the GM will call for the scouting character to make a cunning talent roll, with a target number determined by the nature of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>If the scouting character succeeds, they recognize the challenge before it becomes a problem. They will spot a hazards or enemies from a distance a distance, correctly follow tracks, and keep the group on track.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the scouting character fails the roll, they don’t notice the problem until it is too late. They may not notice hazard or enemies until the group stumbles into them, they may lose whatever tracks they were following for the day, or the group may become lost. If the scouting character fails to spot some enemies, the GM may call for an agility roll to remain hidden from those enemies, otherwise the scouting character will likely be spotted and alert the enemies to the group’s presence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entertaining\">Entertaining</h3>\n\n<p>A character who chooses to entertain the group during makes the experience more enjoyable for characters with similar sensibilities. When deciding to entertain the group, each character should choose a personality trait, to describe the nature of the entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>Entertainment might take the form of a bold retelling of a heroic story, subtle banter and wordplay, an idealistic debate about philosophy, a pragmatic discussion of loot earned or rewards to come, a serious discussion of future plans and tactics, or a carefree musical performance. Any character, even one with any opposite personality trait, may attempt any kind of entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>The GM will call for a simple (TN 6) influence roll of the associated personality trait to see if the entertainment was enjoyable. If the group’s spirits are especially high or low, the GM may adjust the difficulty of the roll to easy(TN 3) or difficult (TN 9), respectively.</p>\n\n<p>If the roll is successful, then any character who has the matching personality trait is relieved of one point of stress at the end of the day. Characters with personality traits opposed to the entertainment might grumble and complain, but aren’t affected for better or worse. Even characters who are scouting or foraging will return to the group often enough to receive the benefits.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"foraging\">Foraging</h3>\n\n<p>A character who decides to forage is looking for resources while traveling. This includes hunting wild game, searching for edible plants, and a foraging character may even find useful crafting ingredients. If the group doesn’t know of any reliable water sources on their journey, foraging for water is especially important.</p>\n\n<p>When a character spends the day foraging, the GM will call for a cunning talent roll to see what they find, with a difficulty based on the scarcity or abundance or resources in the area. Many locations will have a list that lets the GM determine what a successful day’s foraging yields, described in the GM Guidelines chapter below. Successful foraging will most often give supplies and access to water for the day.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"resting\">Resting</h2>\n\n<p>Characters need about eight hours of sleep each night. If a character gets less, they may become stressed, as detailed in the Stress and Affliction chapter below. If characters want to take turns keeping watch for the night, then the whole process including making a breaking camp and eating dinner and breakfast, takes about 12 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Once a character gets their nightly sleep, they recover from one point of stress. Staying in a cozy but modest dwelling might relieve an additional point of stress, while sleeping in a warm soft inn might relieve three in total. However, sleeping in a cold dank cave might cause as much stress as it relieves, and trying to sleep outside in a storm may cause even more.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"damaging-objects\">Damaging Objects</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <h3 id=\"armor-of-materials\">Armor of Materials</h3>\n\n  <table>\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Material</th>\n        <th>Armor</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Glass</td>\n        <td>4</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Paper, Cloth</td>\n        <td>2</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Rope</td>\n        <td>6</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Ice</td>\n        <td>6</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Bone</td>\n        <td>8</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Leather</td>\n        <td>10</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Wood</td>\n        <td>10</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Stone, Crystal</td>\n        <td>15</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Almost anything can be broken with enough time and the right tools. If players have the right tools for the job and no shortage of time, then these rules need not be used, and the characters may simply damage or destroy an object. However, when time is short or damaging an object may cause a commotion, these guidelines may be useful. Objects in character’s inventory or held objects can’t normally be damaged while the character is fighting back.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"breaking-with-damage\">Breaking with Damage</h3>\n\n<p>Inanimate and unattended objects can be damaged and destroyed when they have been dealt enough damage. There are two ways to deal damage to an object; brawn talent rolls and attacks. When a character attempts a brawn roll to damage an object, they quite simply deal damage to the object equal to the result of the roll. Such brawn rolls typically take one action, and boons or banes may be applied as normal.</p>\n\n<p>Objects can also take damage from attacks just like characters. However, objects always take damage from the yield of an attack, never the attack’s threat. Any other effects of the attack or yield may or may not apply to the object at the GM’s discretion.</p>\n\n<p>However, all objects have armor, which reduces the amount of damage they take both from attacks and brawn rolls. Attacks or abilities that ignore a target’s armor don’t ignore an object’s armor unless they specifically say so. An object’s armor is based on its material, as show in the table below.</p>\n\n<p>The GM may also decide that some brawn rolls or attacks using the right tool might be especially destructive, while using the wrong tool might be harmless. A destructive attack or brawn roll deals double damage, before considering armor, while a harmless attempt does nothing. Ranged attacks are usually harmless against objects.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if a character tries burning through a wooden door with a fire attack, the GM may say that is especially destructive. If the attack does 8 damage, that would be doubled to 16, then reduced by armor to 6; enough to burn through over half an inch of the wood.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of damage it takes to break an object is called durability, and is based on the object’s thickness at its thinnest point. For example, a one-inch thick door is just as easy to break no matter how broad it is, but a tree gets more difficult to break the thicker it gets. An object’s durability is equal 1 point of damage per 1/10th inch (1/4th cm) of thickness, regardless of material.</p>\n\n<p>However, trying to break objects with sudden violent force is not without risk. Weather breaking with a brawn roll or an attack, the fate dice will also be rolled. When they roll doom, then the character trying to break the object may suffer stress, the tool being used may become damaged itself, or other consequences may befall the characters.</p>\n\n<p>Players should consider these risks before attempting to break an object. Breaking an object will probably cause a lot of noise as well, which may increase the doom pool if done in an area that is dangerous or deadly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"breaking-eventually\">Breaking Eventually</h3>\n\n<p>If players choose not to risk breaking the object suddenly and violently, they may choose to dismantle an object slowly but steadily.</p>\n\n<p>If a character has a tool that is destructive against the object in question, like an axe for chopping wood or a pickaxe for mining stone, then they may automatically reduce the objects durability by one per round, ignoring armor. If a character has a tool that is less effective but might still work, like a metal file for cutting through an iron bar, they may reduce the durability by one over a minute instead of a round.</p>\n\n<p>This still makes a lot of noise, and may generate doom in hostile territory. Spending time itself may also lead to doom, as described above. If breaking an object takes a long time, the GM may increase the doom pool for the noise as often as doom is added for time. However, breaking an object this way carries little risk of damaging the tool used or the character using it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"damaged-objects\">Damaged Objects</h3>\n\n<p>Many effects of a damaged object are obvious; a damaged door no longer blocks passage, a damaged wagon can’t roll, and so on. Equipment can also be damaged, however damage to equipment can usually be repaired. In extreme cases, like a blade snapped entirely in half, the object may be considered destroyed beyond repair.</p>\n\n<p>A damaged weapon suffers a bane on all attack actions. Damaged armor provides two fewer points of armor, possibly zero. Other damaged equipment can’t be used and doesn’t provide any of its benefits or abilities. Legendary items are no exception and may become damaged or even destroyed as well. However, even if a legendary symbol is broken, the legend itself will remain and find a new symbol in time.</p>\n\n<p>A damaged object can usually be repaired during Downtime, as described below. Adventuring supplies normally include everything needed to repair equipment, such as whetstones to polish out nicks from blades, hammers and spare rivets, plates, and chain links for armor, needle and thread for cloth, and so on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"environmental-effects\">Environmental Effects</h2>\n\n<p>Many strange and exotic environments can affect characters’ skills. A torrential downpour might dowse fire skills, a parched desert may dry up water skills, and the tangled rigging of a ship might hamper skills.</p>\n\n<p>Heavy rain might cause characters to be intractable wet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"strong-winds\">Strong Winds</h3>\n\n<p>Perception is reduced by 2</p>\n\n<p>Ranged attacks suffer a bane</p>\n\n<p>Obscuring clouds and toxic clouds are dispersed at the end of each round.</p>\n\n<p>Skills that fly or jump move at decreased distance</p>\n\n<p>Small open flames such as lanterns, torches, and even magical flames, are blown out.

For a brief time, a character can push, pull, lift or drag an object of bulk equal to five times their carrying capacity, or 10 times if the object can be rolled. If a character wants to move something even heavier, the GM will call for a brawn talent roll.</p>\n \n</div>"},"_id":"2Jm1q4tCvX1bS1iu","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273483988,"modifiedTime":1668273483988,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"LaRxw2AwPTr5SiUW"}

There are three abilities: agility, brawn, and insight. A typical human has a score of about one or two in each ability, but the heroes of Forge of Legends are destined for greatness. When creating a character, each player should assign <strong>seven</strong> ability points to each of the three abilities in the way that best represents their character.\nEach ability may be assigned between zero to five ability points, where zero would be considered below average and five would be extraordinary. Players should think carefully how their character’s abilities would best be described. Once assigned, abilities cannot typically be changed or increased.\nAbilities are used for challenges made to perform feats of skill like leaping across a ravine, sneaking past some guards, and finding hidden secrets. In combat, abilities contribute to a character’s defense (poise, momentum, and focus), used to defend against attacks and power abilities. Abilities also give characters bonuses when using certain types of actions, and influence other combat attributes like speed, armor, and action challenges. These concepts are further explained in the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"combat\" data-path=\"combat\">combat</a> section.\nAbilities don’t determine how characters interact with others, nor what kind of knowledge a character has acquired over the years. Those are determined by a character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"traits\" data-path=\"personality/traits\">personality traits</a> and <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"background\" data-path=\"personality/background\">background details</a>, respectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brawn\">Brawn</h2>\n\n<p>Brawn represents a character’s physical strength and toughness. Brawny characters can use their might to open up new paths by breaking down doors and clearing away rubble. By carrying more inventory items, a brawny character can make sure their group is always ready. In combat, brawny characters excel at going toe-to-toe with enemies in melee combat and outlasting their enemies.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ability rolls to shove heavy objects and run, swim, climb, or jump over physical obstacles are based on brawn.</li>\n  <li>A character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"carrying-capacity\" data-path=\"equipment/carrying-capacity\">carrying capacity</a>, measured in bulk, is equal to five plus five times their brawn.</li>\n  <li>A character’s base <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a> is equal to five plus five times their brawn.

See the equipment section for more details on equipping armor.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"agility\">Agility</h2>\n\n<p>Agility represents a character’s physical coordination and precise control of their body movements. Agile characters can gracefully elude enemies searching for them and balance, squeeze, or tumble their way into areas others would struggle to reach. In combat, agile characters excel quickly finishing off worn-down foes and dashing to the right place at the right time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Abilities rolls to move quickly, carefully, and stealthily are based on agility.</li>\n  <li>A character’s base <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"poise\" data-path=\"combat/poise\">poise</a> is equal to five plus five times their agility.

Next, the GM will determine how easy or difficult the task is, and if any ability or personality trait applies. If the GM decides that the task can’t fail or can’t succeed, it is not a challenge. Finally, the dice will be rolled to determine the outcome.</p>\n<h3 id=\"target-number-tn\">Target Number (TN)</h3>\n\n<p>The GM will assign the challenge a target number, or TN, based on the task’s difficulty. The TN should be determined by considering how easy the task would be for a normal person under normal circumstances, including any tools or strategy they are using. Furthermore, the difficulty is reduced by subtracting the character’s relevant ability score or trait rating from the TN, if applicable. Note that some challenges, such as picking a lock, might not benefit from a character’s abilities or traits. Such challenges would depend on only on the character’s tools and expertise.\nIf a challenge would be opposed by another character, such as an opponent in a debate or picking a pocket, that opponent’s relevant ability score or personality trait increases the TN. When in doubt about who is making the challenge and who is the opponent, assume the player character is the challenger.\nThe TN should not take into account a character’s expertise or unusual circumstances; those are represented as boons or banes to the roll, as described below.

The player has accomplished their goal. However, if none of the dice exceed the TN, then the challenge is <a href=\"doomed\">doomed</a>! Not only has the attempt failed, it has had additional negative consequences. If exactly one of the dice beats the TN, a mixed success has been rolled. The player must then choose: do they succeed at the task but the challenge becomes  <a href=\"doomed\">doomed</a>? Or do their fail at the task at hand but the challenge becomes <a href=\"fated\">fated</a>?\nWhen a challenge is fated, the player may invoke a twist of fate without spending a fate point. However, the detail added to the world must be somehow related to the nature of the challenge, as determined by the GM. The <a href=\"GM%20Guidelines\">GM Guidelines</a> section has more details on doomed and fated challenges.\nA friendly or neutral NPC’s challenges work just like a player’s. However, challenges work slightly differently for hostile or antagonistic NPCs. Whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge would generate a doomed result, then one of the players may invoke a free twist of fate as if they rolled a fated challenge. Conversely, whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge is fated, that generates a doomed effect for the players. The GM will typically choose the player most closely related to the roll to benefit or suffer from NPCs’ fate dice.</p>\n\n<p>&gt;Optional Rule: All or Nothing\n&gt;Your group might wish to offer a player the way to raise the stakes of a challenge. At any time you may add a boon to a challenge. However, if less than three dice exceed the TN, then it is automatically doomed as if 0 dice did.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boons--banes\">Boons &amp; Banes</h3>\n\n<p>If the character has any background details that would make them significantly more component at this task in specific than they normally are at this type of task, each of those details adds a boon to the challenge. Likewise if there are any unusual circumstances that benefit the character, then each of those adds a boon as well.\nFor each boon that a character has on a challenge, roll one additional ten-sided die and compare it to the TN. It counts just like the other dice for determining the success of the roll. Furthermore, if three or more dice beat the TN, then the challenge is fated!  Not only has it succeeded, the roll provides additional benefit to the character.\n&gt;Which background details are specific enough grant a boon?\n&gt;A background detail that could apply to many different challenges is not specific enough to grant a boon. For example, a player might point out that their character is used to sneaking around from their time in the slums, so they should get a boon to sneaking through the forest. However the GM would decide that such a background detail is not specific enough to be relevant to this challenge. On the other hand, if they were sneaking through a city, such a background detail would certainly help.</p>\n\n<p>If the character has any background details that would significantly interfere with their completion of the task, then each of these adds a bane to the challenge. However, the player is awarded a fate point when their background impose a significant hinderance. Having a rich and exciting background tends to pay off in the long term, even when it causes short term complications. Each unusual circumstance that would hider the character also add a bane.\nEach bane that a character has cancels out one of their boons for the challenge. If there are any excess banes, each one of those forces the character to roll another ten-sided die. Then, only the lowest two of all the dice are considered for determining the outcome of the roll.\n&gt;Sometimes, it is only a matter of time before a character accomplishes their goal, such as thoroughly searching an entire room. In that case, the challenges may represent how long it takes to succeed rather than deciding success or failure. The GM may decide how long an action takes, but the higher the roll, the faster it goes. Spending too much time can come with its own risks, outlined in the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"exploration\" data-path=\"exploration/exploration\">Exploration</a> section below.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"group-challenges\">Group Challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes, multiple characters can cooperate toward resolving a challenge. If the challenge is one than benefits from having multiple characters, then the GM will set the TN based on the contributing character for whom the challenge would be easiest. This might be the the character with the highest relevant ability score, the character with the best tools for the job, or the character with the best plan of action. Some circumstances may also raise or lower the target number of the roll. For example, one person trying to lift a horse might be incredible, but for four people it might only be difficult. However, if the challenge would be hindered by multiple participants, such as sneaking around as a group, then the GM will set the TN based on the character for whom the challenge would be most difficult. \nNext, each coopering character may contribute their relevant background details, granting a boon (or a bane for hindering details) for each. Unusual circumstances that apply boons or banes should be accounted for as well A circumstance only needs to affect one character, not all characters, in order to add a boon or bane, . Finally, one player rolls the dice to determine the result of the entire group. If the challenge becomes mixed, fated or doomed, all participants should collaborate to decide what happens.</p>"},"_id":"SDiVLQ79L4Ehu2Lc","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273498230,"modifiedTime":1668273498230,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"U2JzDRHEiyPN5SEO"}

{"name":"Playing the Game","flags":{"forgeoflegends":{"path":"playing"}},"pages":[{"name":"Playing the Game","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1 id=\"playing-the-game\">Playing the Game</h1>\n\n<p>Once the players have created their characters, they are ready to begin playing! At the basic level, playing forge of legends is quite simple:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The GM describes the scene and any relevant information.</li>\n  <li>The players say what their characters try to do.</li>\n  <li>The GM decides which if any rules apply and tells the player their odds of success.</li>\n  <li>The player character may attempt the chosen activity, rolling dice to determine the result if necessary.</li>\n  <li>The gamemaster describes the outcomes and consequences of the players’ actions.\nPlayers can cooperate to attempt to do anything they can think of in the game world, but they will often be offered a quest or goal by the GM. These goals will often take players to exotic and dangerous locales, where they must defeat fearsome enemies to save the day. However, players are encouraged to look for unorthodox and creative solutions to problems, that’s the stuff that legends are made of!\nThere are three ways a player might try to achieve their goal: fate, challenges, and skills</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Overcoming these challenges will reward players with experience, which can be used to unlock new skills. Players may also acquire new weapons and equipment that give them new ways to solve problems.\nIf tough enemies try to stop the players, they may engage in combat to determine a victor! During combat, players and enemies controlled by the GM take turns until one side gives up the fight or is defeated.\nBeing defeated in combat, environmental hazards, and distressing experiences can all increase a character’s stress. If a character’s stress rises too high, they suffer afflictions which will force them to rethink their strategy. Stress can accumulate quickly when heroes risk their live against great odds, and only heals slowly when surrounded by safety and comfort. Characters must manage their stress carefully if they want to avoid afflictions, unconsciousness, and even death.\nThe ultimate goal of this game is to Forge a Legend! A legendary deed is earned when players defeat legendary foes, succeed at legendary challenges, or otherwise create outstanding and memorable experiences at the table. Each legendary deed will result in a completely unique legendary item that commemorates the deed that earned it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fate--doom\">Fate &amp; Doom</h1>\n\n<p>Fate is funny thing. Heroes, especially those who stay true to themselves and to their friends, often find that destiny is on their side. In Forge of Legends, fate is a system for rewarding players for expressing their characters’ personality, and for giving players some control over the game world beyond the actions of their characters.\nPlayers will gain fate through fateful deeds: momentous decisions which are described in the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"personality\" data-path=\"personality\">Personality</a> section. Characters also gain fate whenever one of their background details poses a significant obstacle to themselves or the group, as determined by the GM. Some GMs may choose to award fate points to players who make the game more fun for everyone, such as taking an amazing risk or spouting an exceptional joke.\nWhen a player earns a fate point, they should add it to their total number and keep track of them. Each player may save up to 3 fate points at a time. If a player already has 3 fate points when they earn another, they may give their new fate point to another player instead.  Note that fate points belong to an individual player, not merely their character. Players may gain and spend fate points even in situations where their character is not present, if the GM deems it appropriate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"twists-of-fate\">Twists of Fate</h2>\n\n<p>Players may spend their fate points by invoking a twist of fate at any time to add detail to the game world. Some common twists of fate would be: adding a feature to the environment, adding an item to their character’s inventory, or embellishing their character’s background, all of which may add bonuses or penalties. Any detail, no matter the subject and no matter how large or small, can be invoked by a twist of fate. However, players may only add detail, not remove or change details that have already been established.\nWhen a player declares that they would like to invoke a twist of fate, they should describe the detail they would like to add to the world. The game master then decides if that detail could reasonably exist, and if it hasn’t already been established. If so, the player may spend their fate point and the detail they suggested is added to the game world. Alternatively, a successful <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"challenge\" data-path=\"playing/challenge\">challenge</a> might allow a player to invoke a twist of fate for free!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"doom\">Doom</h2>\n\n<p>The doom pool represents long term complications that impose obstacles between them and their goals. Many things can generate doom, such as failing challenges, dawdling in dangerous locales, and the machinations of the villains. The GM Guidelines section dictates how the GM can use doom, but it will always be used to cause problems for the players. Players should try their best to minimize the amount of doom the GM accrues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"challenges\">Challenges</h2>\n\n<p>Many obstacles that characters encounter will require a challenge to overcome. The gamemaster will call for a challenge when a character attempts a task where the outcome is in doubt. First the player should describe the task their character will attempt and what they hope to accomplish with it. Next, the GM will determine how easy or difficult the task is, and if any ability or personality trait applies. If the GM decides that the task can’t fail or can’t succeed, it is not a challenge. Finally, the dice will be rolled to determine the outcome.</p>\n<h3 id=\"target-number-tn\">Target Number (TN)</h3>\n\n<p>The GM will assign the challenge a target number, or TN, based on the task’s difficulty. The TN should be determined by considering how easy the task would be for a normal person under normal circumstances, including any tools or strategy they are using. Furthermore, the difficulty is reduced by subtracting the character’s relevant ability score or trait rating from the TN, if applicable. Note that some challenges, such as picking a lock, might not benefit from a character’s abilities or traits. Such challenges would depend on only on the character’s tools and expertise.\nIf a challenge would be opposed by another character, such as an opponent in a debate or picking a pocket, that opponent’s relevant ability score or personality trait increases the TN. When in doubt about who is making the challenge and who is the opponent, assume the player character is the challenger.\nThe TN should not take into account a character’s expertise or unusual circumstances; those are represented as boons or banes to the roll, as described below. The “Difficulty” table provides guidelines and examples for target numbers, and additional information for setting target numbers can be found in the <a href=\"GM%20Guidelines\">GM Guidelines</a> section.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"difficulty\">Difficulty</h3>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Roll Difficulty</td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| ————————</td>\n      <td>—-</td>\n      <td>————————————————————</td>\n      <td>———————–</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Difficulty</td>\n      <td>TN</td>\n      <td>Description</td>\n      <td>Example Task</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Trivial</td>\n      <td>NA</td>\n      <td>Everyone can do it; no  roll is needed</td>\n      <td>Walking</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Easy</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>Most people can do it most of  the time</td>\n      <td>Climbing a tree</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Moderate</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>A moderate challenge for most  people</td>\n      <td>Spotting a snake</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Difficult</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>A demanding task,  even for an expert</td>\n      <td>Stalking a deer</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Incredible</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>Even an expert is likely to fail</td>\n      <td>Catching an arrow</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Legendary</td>\n      <td>12+</td>\n      <td>Even attempting it  sounds ludicrous and succeeding may well be a legendary deed</td>\n      <td>Riding a dragon</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>| Impossible</td>\n      <td>NA</td>\n      <td>Some things simply cannot be  done…</td>\n      <td>Leaping to the moon</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3 id=\"rolling-the-dice\">Rolling the Dice</h3>\n\n<p>Once the TN has been set, the player then rolls two ten-sided dice. The result of each die is independently compared to the target number, and each die that equals or exceeds the target number improves the result.\nIf two of the dice are equal to or higher than the TN, the challenge is a success! The player has accomplished their goal. However, if none of the dice exceed the TN, then the challenge is <a href=\"doomed\">doomed</a>! Not only has the attempt failed, it has had additional negative consequences. If exactly one of the dice beats the TN, a mixed success has been rolled. The player must then choose: do they succeed at the task but the challenge becomes  <a href=\"doomed\">doomed</a>? Or do their fail at the task at hand but the challenge becomes <a href=\"fated\">fated</a>?\nWhen a challenge is fated, the player may invoke a twist of fate without spending a fate point. However, the detail added to the world must be somehow related to the nature of the challenge, as determined by the GM. The <a href=\"GM%20Guidelines\">GM Guidelines</a> section has more details on doomed and fated challenges.\nA friendly or neutral NPC’s challenges work just like a player’s. However, challenges work slightly differently for hostile or antagonistic NPCs. Whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge would generate a doomed result, then one of the players may invoke a free twist of fate as if they rolled a fated challenge. Conversely, whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge is fated, that generates a doomed effect for the players. The GM will typically choose the player most closely related to the roll to benefit or suffer from NPCs’ fate dice.</p>\n\n<p>&gt;Optional Rule: All or Nothing\n&gt;Your group might wish to offer a player the way to raise the stakes of a challenge. At any time you may add a boon to a challenge. However, if less than three dice exceed the TN, then it is automatically doomed as if 0 dice did.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boons--banes\">Boons &amp; Banes</h3>\n\n<p>If the character has any background details that would make them significantly more component at this task in specific than they normally are at this type of task, each of those details adds a boon to the challenge. Likewise if there are any unusual circumstances that benefit the character, then each of those adds a boon as well.\nFor each boon that a character has on a challenge, roll one additional ten-sided die and compare it to the TN. It counts just like the other dice for determining the success of the roll. Furthermore, if three or more dice beat the TN, then the challenge is fated!  Not only has it succeeded, the roll provides additional benefit to the character.\n&gt;Which background details are specific enough grant a boon?\n&gt;A background detail that could apply to many different challenges is not specific enough to grant a boon. For example, a player might point out that their character is used to sneaking around from their time in the slums, so they should get a boon to sneaking through the forest. However the GM would decide that such a background detail is not specific enough to be relevant to this challenge. On the other hand, if they were sneaking through a city, such a background detail would certainly help.</p>\n\n<p>If the character has any background details that would significantly interfere with their completion of the task, then each of these adds a bane to the challenge. However, the player is awarded a fate point when their background impose a significant hinderance. Having a rich and exciting background tends to pay off in the long term, even when it causes short term complications. Each unusual circumstance that would hider the character also add a bane.\nEach bane that a character has cancels out one of their boons for the challenge. If there are any excess banes, each one of those forces the character to roll another ten-sided die. Then, only the lowest two of all the dice are considered for determining the outcome of the roll.\n&gt;Sometimes, it is only a matter of time before a character accomplishes their goal, such as thoroughly searching an entire room. In that case, the challenges may represent how long it takes to succeed rather than deciding success or failure. The GM may decide how long an action takes, but the higher the roll, the faster it goes. Spending too much time can come with its own risks, outlined in the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"exploration\" data-path=\"exploration/exploration\">Exploration</a> section below.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"group-challenges\">Group Challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes, multiple characters can cooperate toward resolving a challenge. If the challenge is one than benefits from having multiple characters, then the GM will set the TN based on the contributing character for whom the challenge would be easiest. This might be the the character with the highest relevant ability score, the character with the best tools for the job, or the character with the best plan of action. Some circumstances may also raise or lower the target number of the roll. For example, one person trying to lift a horse might be incredible, but for four people it might only be difficult. However, if the challenge would be hindered by multiple participants, such as sneaking around as a group, then the GM will set the TN based on the character for whom the challenge would be most difficult. \nNext, each coopering character may contribute their relevant background details, granting a boon (or a bane for hindering details) for each. Unusual circumstances that apply boons or banes should be accounted for as well A circumstance only needs to affect one character, not all characters, in order to add a boon or bane, . Finally, one player rolls the dice to determine the result of the entire group. If the challenge becomes mixed, fated or doomed, all participants should collaborate to decide what happens.</p>"},"_id":"oRw0JtbJ78hAhozQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273498220,"modifiedTime":1668273498220,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"XiVhH9BbtGW6txIq"}

When the GM or players ask if the characters have some specific knowledge about a subject, the GM will call for a lore check, and assign a lore rating necessary to reveal the information, based on the table below.\nThe players should review their characters’ backgrounds and point out any background detail that might be relevant to the subject. Each relevant background detail adds one to the group’s lore check on the subject. If one or more characters have multiple similar background details, then only one should be counted to determine the group’s lore check. However, if different characters or different background details can offer different perspectives, then each one should be added to the group’s lore check.\nFinally, the GM compare’s the group’s lore check to the necessary lore rating to reveal the information. If the group passes the check, then the GM reveals the information to them. No dice are rolled to determine what a character knows; either they have enough experience from their backgrounds, or they don’t.\nIf a character or group is revealed to have an insufficient lore rating, there are a few things they could do to increase their knowledge. They may try to seek out a person, book, or other source of information that can help them reach the required rating.

Yet these artifacts are not simply manufactured by famous smiths or enchanted by powerful wizards. Heroic and momentous deeds will be remembered as legends, and those legends themselves hold power. A legendary item is imbued with the spirit of the wonderous event it symbolizes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"legendary-deeds\">Legendary Deeds</h2>\n\n<p>The first step toward forging a legend is achieving a legendary deed. A legendary deed is a feat that will be recounted and admired for countless generations to come. Whenever the player characters do something extraordinary, the GM may declare that they have achieved a legendary deed. There are many ways to accomplish a legendary deed, such as defeating a powerful foe, ingeniously overcoming an obstacle, or performing an amazing feat of skill. There are no limits on what could be considered a legendary deed, but the deed must be truly legendary - a tale worth retelling through the ages!\nSome of the more common way to achieve a legendary deed are to defeat a legendary foe, such as a mighty dragon, or to succeed on a challenge of legendary difficulty.\nPlayers should nominate the actions of other group members if their deeds seem suitably legendary. However, the GM may make the final decision. A legendary deed may not always be recognized right away. If the group comes to realize how incredible a past action truly was, the GM may declare the past action to be a legendary deed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"commemorating-a-legend\">Commemorating a Legend</h2>\n\n<p>Once a legendary deed has been achieved, it must then be commemorated. This is a process of discussion between the players and the GM detailing how the legend should be remembered and expressed in the game. There are five details each legend must have to be commemorated: a major effect, a minor effect, a symbol, a name, and an inscription.\nThe players must decide the nature or essence of the legendary item’s effects, and the GM should decide the specific powers and limitations based on the players’ decisions. The effects of the item must be closely tied to legendary deed that creates them. Precisely how close may be determined by the GM, but the connection between the events of the legendary deed and the effects of the item must be clear and obvious to anyone who is told.\nIf one character stands out in the events of legendary deed, their opinion should be held in higher regard. But ultimately, commemorating a legend is an activity to be shared by the whole group.</p>\n<h3 id=\"major-effects\">Major Effects</h3>\n\n<p>Major effects are the most important part of legendary items, and the things for which such items will be renowned. Many major effects will take the form of powerful skills. They may be combat abilities or be valuable for exploration and interaction. They may be passive skills that are always in effect, skills that must be recovered between uses, or powerful skills that can only ever be used once.\nThe GM should decide on a suitable major effect based on the player’s suggestions. If the players aren’t satisfied with the GM’s decision, they may request different a major effect. But that too should be balanced by the GM. For balance guidelines, see the GM Guidelines chapter. Some examples of major effect include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Attacks with the item may gain the fire tag.</li>\n  <li>The item may be used to cause plants in the area to grow rapidly and restrain foes.</li>\n  <li>The item may be used to reveal things that otherwise could not be seen.</li>\n  <li>The item grants immunity to some specific condition.</li>\n  <li>The item instantly returns to its owner’s hand when commanded.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"minor-effects\">Minor Effects</h3>\n\n<p>Minor effects have little to no direct benefit, but instead symbolize the spirit and meaning of the legend. Minor effect may include aesthetic effects, slight convinces, or demonstrations of the item’s power. Minor effects should never grant skills. Some examples of minor effects include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The item glows with harmless fire at the bearer’s command.</li>\n  <li>Flowers blossom in the footsteps of the bearer</li>\n  <li>The bearer’s eyes glow with power.</li>\n  <li>The item can never be damaged, tarnished, cracked, or ripped.</li>\n  <li>The owner can always sense their distance from the item.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"symbol\">Symbol</h3>\n\n<p>The symbol of the legend is a physical object that will bear the power of the legendary deed such as a weapon, a piece of equipment, or some other item. Choosing an object closely tied to the events of the legendary deed may make the connection between deed and effects more obvious, allowing a broader range of effects. However, the symbol may also be unrelated to the events of the legendary deed.\nEach object may only be the symbol for one legend at a time. One legend may be replaced by another on a specific symbol, but only if the two legends are related in a way that feels like one continuous story. For example, a wicked and evil blade may be redeemed by defeating the villain who forged it.\nIf the chosen symbol is a weapon or other piece of equipment with existing skills, the legendary effects may replace one of the item’s skills. Legendary items take on a life of their own and are not strictly upgrades to existing items.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"name\">Name</h3>\n\n<p>The name of the legend may be anything that the players choose, but it should inspire memories of the people and events that created it. A unique and evocative name is a mandatory part of any legendary item.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"inscription\">inscription</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, once the effects, symbol and name have been established, one character of the group’s choice may inscribe the legend. The chosen character must inscribe runes representing the name of the legend onto the chosen symbol over a few hours. Once the character has finished inscribing the runes, the legend has been forged, and the new legendary item is ready to use!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"legendary-quests\">Legendary Quests</h2>\n\n<p>Many legendary deeds arise spontaneously out of heroic bravery, the demands of desperate situations, or just plain good luck. But some legendary items are created by grand aspirations and hard work. Legendary quests allow players to forge a specific legendary item of their choosing, but only after overcoming an appropriate adventure.\nA player seeking to undertake a legendary quest should announce their intention to the GM. The player may describe any kind of legendary item they want, not merely one related to recent deeds. As with commemorating a legend, the GM and the player should come to an agreement on the item’s powers, effects, and limitations.\nAs part of this discussion, the GM should determine a legendary quest needed to earn this item. The legendary quest could be anything from a single encounter to an epic odyssey, as befitting the legendary item. But whatever the quest, it must be symbolically related to the effects of the legendary item it will create.\nIf the player does not accept the legendary quest that the GM requires, or if the GM can’t offer a suitable legendary quest at the time, then nothing happens. If the player does accept the legendary quest offered to them, then they should keep track of it and work toward it as best they can. Once legendary quest has been overcome, that completes the legendary deed needed to forge the chosen legend!\nEach character may only undertake one legendary quest at a time. A character may abandon a legendary quest at any time, but doing so causes the character three stress. Giving up on one’s dreams is always disheartening.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"legends-of-old\">Legends of Old</h2>\n\n<p>Not all legendary items will be created by the players. Many legends have left their mark on the world already. All legendary items are the symbols for legendary deeds of the past and have effects that reflect those epic histories. \nLegendary items are memorable by their very nature, and it is obvious to anyone if a particular item has a legendary past. However the name and effects of an item are not always obvious. Holding and meditating upon an unknown legendary item for one minute imparts a vague knowledge of the legendary deed that created it.

Some skills have useful effects outside of combat, while others help characters defeat their enemies and protect their allies. All skills have a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"type\" data-path=\"skills/type\">type</a>, a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"target\" data-path=\"skills/target\">target</a>, and <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"tags\" data-path=\"skills/tags\">tags</a>, that describe how the skill may be used. Most skills have <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"effects\" data-path=\"skills/effects\">effects</a> that describe what the skill does when used, and some skills may also cost or grant <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"defense\" data-path=\"combat/defense\">defense</a> when used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"skill-types\">Skill Types</h2>\n\n<p>Each skill has a type that describes how it is used in combat. There are four types of skills: Actions, Maneuvers, Reactions, &amp; Passives.</p>\n<h3 id=\"actions\">Actions</h3>\n\n<p>Actions are often a character’s most powerful skills, including most attacks against enemies and skills to support allies. Characters may use one action on their turn.  Actions may benefit from a character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"agility\" data-path=\"abilities/agility\">agility</a>, <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"brawn\" data-path=\"abilities/brawn\">brawn</a>, and/or <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"insight\" data-path=\"abilities/insight\">insight</a>, depending on the action’s target, as detailed in the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"target\" data-path=\"skills/target\">skill targets</a> section below. Actions require a challenge to see how well they succeed, as detailed in the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action-challenge\" data-path=\"skills/action-challenge\">action challenge</a> section below. After a character uses an action, all <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"temporary\" data-path=\"conditions/temporary\">temporary</a> <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"conditions\" data-path=\"conditions\">conditions</a> are removed from them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"maneuvers\">Maneuvers</h3>\n\n<p>Each character may only use one maneuver each turn. A character can give up their action to use a second maneuver on their turn, but if they do, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"flat-footed\" data-path=\"conditions/flat-footed\">flat-footed</a>. A character cannot use an action in the middle of a maneuver, or vice-versa. A character may move up to their speed as part of any maneuver that isn’t <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"slow\" data-path=\"skills/slow\">slow</a>, but not maneuvers that are slow. Using a maneuver in an enemy’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"zone-of-control\" data-path=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone of control</a> risks being <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"hinder\" data-path=\"combat/hinder\">hinder</a>, unless it it <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"careful\" data-path=\"skills/careful\">careful</a>. A Maneuver doesn’t normally involve a challenge unless it involves moving though an unusual area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reactions\">Reactions</h3>\n\n<p>Reactions may be used at any time, even during another character’s turn and interrupting another a skill. However, all reactions have a <strong>trigger</strong>, which must be met before the reaction can be used. A character can use reactions as often as their triggers are met are met, but normally only once per triggering event. A reaction doesn’t normally involve a challenge.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"passive\">Passive</h3>\n\n<p>Passive skills are always in effect, and a character always receives their benefits.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other\">Other</h3>\n\n<p>Other skills take more than one action, and will specify how long they take to complete. A character must <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"concentration\" data-path=\"skills/concentration\">concentrate</a> on the skill for the duration in order to complete the skill. If they are interrupted, then nothing happens, and any resources spent on the skill are not consumed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"skill-targets\">Skill Targets</h2>\n\n<p>All non-<a class=\"keyword\" title=\"passive\" data-path=\"skills/passive\">passive</a> skills have a target, which describes who or what is affected by the skill. A character must be able to see the target(s) of a skill, with the exception of <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"burst\" data-path=\"skills/burst\">burst</a> skills and skills that only target the user. The targets of a skill must be chosen before any effects, costs, threat or yields come into effect. If a skill targets multiple different characters, then each may independently choose how to respond to the skill. Some skills may also specify special targeting rules that must be followed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"utility\">Utility</h3>\n\n<p>Utility skills are the broadest category of skills, and may aid oneself or allies in or outside of combat. Unless specified otherwise, a character can target themselves with utility skills, and the user us always considered the target of a utility skill that is neither melee or ranged. Utility skills are capable of affecting enemies as well, but they are never attacks.\nWhenever a character uses a utility action, they may choose one of two bonuses to add to the effect. Either they themselves gain momentum equal to their brawn, or one target gains focus equal to their insight. If the character targets themselves, they may gain either momentum or focus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"attack\">Attack</h3>\n\n<p>An attack is a hostile skill that attempts to reduce the target’s defense and apply other effects, such as negative conditions. In addition to the usual features of a skill, all attacks have a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"threat\" data-path=\"combat/threat\">threat</a> and a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"yield\" data-path=\"combat/yield\">yield</a>. A character targeted by an attack most choose between the threat or the yield, both of which will be harmful in different ways. See the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attacking\" data-path=\"combat/attacking\">attacking &amp; defending</a> section for details on what a character must do when targeted by an attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"threat\">Threat</h3>\n\n<p>The threat of the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attack</a> represents how difficult an attack is to avoid. Each attack has a number that represents its threat, and a character adds their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"agility\" data-path=\"abilities/agility\">agility</a> to the threat of any attack that is also an <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yield\">Yield</h3>\n\n<p>An <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attack’s</a> yield describes what the attack does if it is not <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attacking\" data-path=\"combat/attacking\">mitigated</a>. Almost all attacks will deal damage to <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"poise\" data-path=\"combat/poise\">poise</a>, <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a>, or <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"focus\" data-path=\"combat/focus\">focus</a>, along with some additional effect specified by the skill. Characters add their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"brawn\" data-path=\"abilities/brawn\">brawn</a> to the yield damage of <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"melee\" data-path=\"skills/melee\">melee</a> attacks. Yielding to an attack <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a> also means rolling a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"challenge\" data-path=\"playing/challenge\">challenge</a> to determine if the attack is a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"critical\" data-path=\"skills/critical\">critical</a> or <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"twist-of-fate\" data-path=\"playing/twist-of-fate\">twist of fate</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"melee\">Melee</h3>\n\n<p>A melee skill can target one character who is within one space of the character using the skill. A melee utility skill can usually target the character using it, but melee attacks can’t. A character adds their brawn to the damage of melee attack actions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ranged\">Ranged</h3>\n\n<p>A ranged skill will specify a maximum range, such as “Ranged: 10”. This range is increased by a character’s insight. A ranged skill can target one character within the maximum range. Using a ranged action in an enemy’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"zone-of-control\" data-path=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone of control</a> let’s that enemy impose a bane on the skill.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"line\">Line</h3>\n\n<p>A line always specifies a range and begins from the character using the skill. The character may draw a line in any direction, and the skill targets any space or character that the line passes though, up to the maximum range. Line skills require precision and cannot target a character that cannot be seen; they automatically fail to affect unseen characters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"burst\">Burst</h3>\n\n<p>A burst is a sphere that spreads out from the center a number of spaces specified by the skill. For example, a two-space burst would include the center of the area as well as all spaces up to two spaces away from the center. Bursts cannot normally go through walls, but can spread around them.\nA burst can be <strong>central</strong>, <strong>point-blank</strong>, or <strong>within range</strong>. A central burst means the area of the skill must be directly centered on the character using it If a character occupies more than one space, they choose one of their spaces as the center of the burst. A point-blank burst means that at least one space of the burst must be adjacent to the character using the skill, and no space can include the character. A burst within range means that the center of the burst may be anywhere within the range of the skill. Note that the range applies to the center of the area, so it is possible for a character to be affected even beyond the listed range.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"skill-costs\">Skill Costs</h2>\n\n<p>A skill may list a type of <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"defense\" data-path=\"combat/defense\">defense</a> that it grants or costs when used. A positive number grants the character using it the specified amount of the specified type of defense. If the character can’t currently gain that type of defense, for example if they are <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"knocked-down\" data-path=\"combat/knocked-down\">knocked-down</a> and trying to gain <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a>, then the character may still use the skill but they gain no defense from it.\nA negative number means that the skill costs defense, which must be paid before the skill can be used; this cost is unaffected by a character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"armor\" data-path=\"abilities/armor\">armor</a>. If the character cannot pay the cost, they cannot use the skill. If a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reaction\" data-path=\"skills/reaction\">reaction</a> changes the character’s defense after they use the skill but before it comes into effect and leaves them unable to pay the cost, then the skill does nothing and the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a>, <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"maneuver\" data-path=\"skills/maneuver\">maneuver</a>, or <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reaction\" data-path=\"skills/reaction\">reaction</a> opportunity used on the skill is wasted.\nA character may invoke a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; to use a skill without paying its defense cost, but doing so leaves the character drained of energy and automatically &lt;a href=\" data-path=\"final%20gambit\">final gambit</a> to use a skill without paying its defense cost, but doing so leaves the character drained of energy and automatically <a href=\"combat/defeated\">defeated</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"skill-effects\">Skill Effects</h2>\n\n<p>A skill’s effects describe what it actually does when used. Most skills have effects, except for some straightforward attacks. Effects of a skill are not usually optional, they happen weather or not a character wants them to happen, although they may give a character options. Effects of a skill are always decided and resolved after the cost of the skill and before any other rules. If there is ever any uncertainty regarding exactly what a skill’s effects do, the GM will make the final decision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"concentration\">Concentration</h3>\n\n<p>Some skills require the user’s active concentration to maintain the effects. Unlike most other effects of a skill, concentration effects may be ignored by the character using the skill if desired. While a character is concentrating on an effect, they may release their concentration any time on a friendly character’s turn, but not on an enemy’s turn.\nConcentrating on a skill doesn’t come with any inherent cost or penalty, however it does have a few stipulations. For one, a character may only concentrate on one skill at a time. If a character uses a second concentration skill while they are already concentrating on another one, then they must either release concentration on the first skill or ignore the concentration effects of the second skill.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"interrupting-concentration\">Interrupting Concentration</h3>\n\n<p>A character who is concentrating can be interrupted by other skills and effects. Interrupting a character is also an option for an attack’s twist of fate (but not a critical). When a character’s concentration is interrupted, any effects they were concentrating on immediately end. Some concentration effects are automatically interrupted when specific events come to pass, and some skills might do something special when they are interrupted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"action-challenges\">Action Challenges</h2>\n\n<p>A challenge is required every time a character uses a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"utility\" data-path=\"skills/utility\">utility</a> <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a> skill, or <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"yield\" data-path=\"combat/yield\">yields</a> to an <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attack</a> <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a> skill. Challenges aren’t normally used for <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"maneuver\" data-path=\"skills/maneuver\">maneuvers</a>, <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reaction\" data-path=\"skills/reaction\">reactions</a>, or <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"passive\" data-path=\"skills/passive\">passive</a> skills.\nThe target number for an action challenge is 10, and the character using the skill further reduces the TN by their insight. Other effects, such as boons and banes, can also modify a skill’s TN. Two ten-sided dice are rolled, however, the results of an action challenge are interpreted differently than a normal challenge.\nIf none of the dice beat the TN, then nothing happens; no additional complications arise. If exactly one of the dice beat the TN, then the action is a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"critical\" data-path=\"skills/critical\">critical</a>! Critical actions grant bonus effects based on the type of skill used. If two or more dice beat the TN, then the action is fated! The character may choose two critical effects or invoke a free <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"twist-of-fate\" data-path=\"playing/twist-of-fate\">twist of fate</a> related to the action. However, If all dice involved in an action challenge roll “1” or below, then the action is doomed and suffers a complication. If an action has multiple targets, a separate challenge should be rolled for each.</p>\n<h3 id=\"criticals\">Criticals</h3>\n\n<p>When exactly one die of an <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a>’s challenge beat the TN, that action is a critical and gains bonus effects. Precisely which critical effects are added to the action depends on the action’s tags. For example, a critical <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"water\" data-path=\"skills/water\">water</a> skill can make the target <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"wet\" data-path=\"conditions/wet\">wet</a>.\nSome critical effects offer a defense bonus as an alternative; if the skill is an <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attack</a>, that bonus is added to the damage of the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"yield\" data-path=\"combat/yield\">yield</a>. If it is a utility skill, then one target is granted that defense bonus.

If a character is immune to a specific tag, then the &lt;a href=\" data-path=\"condition\">condition</a>, then that condition can’t be applied to that character. If a character is immune to a specific tag, then the <a href=\"combat/threat\">threat</a> of any any <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attack</a> with that tag is reduced to 0, effectively allowing the character to ignore that attack.

This is a process of discussion between the players and the GM detailing how the legend should be remembered and expressed in the game. There are five details each legend must have to be commemorated: a major effect, a minor effect, a symbol, a name, and an inscription.\nThe players must decide the nature or essence of the legendary item’s effects, and the GM should decide the specific powers and limitations based on the players’ decisions. The effects of the item must be closely tied to legendary deed that creates them. Precisely how close may be determined by the GM, but the connection between the events of the legendary deed and the effects of the item must be clear and obvious to anyone who is told.\nIf one character stands out in the events of legendary deed, their opinion should be held in higher regard. But ultimately, commemorating a legend is an activity to be shared by the whole group.</p>\n<h3 id=\"major-effects\">Major Effects</h3>\n\n<p>Major effects are the most important part of legendary items, and the things for which such items will be renowned. Many major effects will take the form of powerful skills. They may be combat abilities or be valuable for exploration and interaction. They may be passive skills that are always in effect, skills that must be recovered between uses, or powerful skills that can only ever be used once.\nThe GM should decide on a suitable major effect based on the player’s suggestions. If the players aren’t satisfied with the GM’s decision, they may request different a major effect. But that too should be balanced by the GM. For balance guidelines, see the GM Guidelines chapter. Some examples of major effect include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Attacks with the item may gain the fire tag.</li>\n  <li>The item may be used to cause plants in the area to grow rapidly and restrain foes.</li>\n  <li>The item may be used to reveal things that otherwise could not be seen.</li>\n  <li>The item grants immunity to some specific condition.</li>\n  <li>The item instantly returns to its owner’s hand when commanded.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"minor-effects\">Minor Effects</h3>\n\n<p>Minor effects have little to no direct benefit, but instead symbolize the spirit and meaning of the legend. Minor effect may include aesthetic effects, slight convinces, or demonstrations of the item’s power. Minor effects should never grant skills. Some examples of minor effects include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The item glows with harmless fire at the bearer’s command.</li>\n  <li>Flowers blossom in the footsteps of the bearer</li>\n  <li>The bearer’s eyes glow with power.</li>\n  <li>The item can never be damaged, tarnished, cracked, or ripped.</li>\n  <li>The owner can always sense their distance from the item.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"symbol\">Symbol</h3>\n\n<p>The symbol of the legend is a physical object that will bear the power of the legendary deed such as a weapon, a piece of equipment, or some other item. Choosing an object closely tied to the events of the legendary deed may make the connection between deed and effects more obvious, allowing a broader range of effects. However, the symbol may also be unrelated to the events of the legendary deed.\nEach object may only be the symbol for one legend at a time. One legend may be replaced by another on a specific symbol, but only if the two legends are related in a way that feels like one continuous story. For example, a wicked and evil blade may be redeemed by defeating the villain who forged it.\nIf the chosen symbol is a weapon or other piece of equipment with existing skills, the legendary effects may replace one of the item’s skills. Legendary items take on a life of their own and are not strictly upgrades to existing items.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"name\">Name</h3>\n\n<p>The name of the legend may be anything that the players choose, but it should inspire memories of the people and events that created it. A unique and evocative name is a mandatory part of any legendary item.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"inscription\">inscription</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, once the effects, symbol and name have been established, one character of the group’s choice may inscribe the legend. The chosen character must inscribe runes representing the name of the legend onto the chosen symbol over a few hours. Once the character has finished inscribing the runes, the legend has been forged, and the new legendary item is ready to use!</p>"},"_id":"wtyEVFEgF8eOC92p","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273498094,"modifiedTime":1668273498094,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"q1kIeSMv7ZcAKIUt"}

This could include old and mundane information such as where a character was born and who their family is. But it can also include new and fantastic details such as recent adventures.\nAll these background details may become relevant for challenges and lore checks. If a player believes that one or more of a character’s background details would provide them with valuable insight or experience toward achieving their goal, they should point the connection out to the GM. Even players who are not involved in the roll may point out how another character’s background is helpful in a given situation. The GM may ask the player how that experience is relevant, and if the GM agrees, then then detail aids the character.\nPlayers should write down as much information about their character as they think is relevant, with the GM’s permission. However, it is okay if a player doesn’t have their character’s entire background detailed when the character is first created, because a character’s background can always be embellished.</p>\n<h3 id=\"embellishing-a-background\">Embellishing a Background</h3>\n\n<p>At any time, a character may ask to embellish their background by adding more details. This is a kind of twist of fate and follows all the same rules, such as only adding detail and not changing established facts. If the GM agrees that the proposed embellishment is reasonable in the context of the character’s existing background, then the player may spend a point of fate to add the embellishment to their character’s background.\nIn general, embellishing a character’s background is easier if fewer details have already been established, and if the detail being added is consistent with the background details that the character already has. The GM should be more permissive of characters who have few background details already established or few that have aided them on their quest so far. Everyone comes from somewhere, and all characters are entitles to backgrounds that help them achieve their goals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flaws--fate\">Flaws &amp; Fate</h3>\n\n<p>The characters of Forge of Legends are still just people, and often come with their own weakness, foibles, and flaws. But fate smiles upon those who admit their shortcomings. A character’s flaws are background details just like any others. However, whenever a character’s flaws or other background details create a significant problem for the character or group, as determined by the GM, that character gains a point of fate. Characters with interesting flaws or double-edged background details will find more opportunities to be favored by fate.</p>"},"_id":"bHCRGB9Im50cyPsT","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273498150,"modifiedTime":1668273498150,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"sOALdzW2SRM3Tw2r"}

Any other characters may use a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reaction\" data-path=\"skills/reaction\">reaction</a> to immediately draw any <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"weapon\" data-path=\"skills/weapon\">weapons</a> they have equipped.\nA character may use two <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; on their turn, one &lt;a class=\" data-path=\"skill\">skills</a> on their turn, one <a href=\"skills/action\">action</a> and one <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"maneuver\" data-path=\"skills/maneuver\">maneuver</a>.

A character may use reactions on their own turn, as well as during other characters’ turns. Characters must typically finish one action before starting another; a character can’t move a few spaces with a maneuver, use an action, then finish the rest of the maneuver’s movement.\nOnce a character has finished their turn, an enemy character takes a turn. Typically, combat will occur between the group player characters and one group of NPCs controlled by the GM. When an enemy NPC finishes a turn, the players will collaborate to choose one of their characters who has not yet acted to take the next turn. When a player character finishes their turn, the GM will choose one NPC combatant who has not taken a turn to take the next turn. This cycle continues until all characters have taken their turns.\nIf all characters on one side have taken their turns, and other characters on the enemy side have not, then the other side may take their turns back to back until all characters have taken a turn. Once the last character in the combat has taken their turn, the round ends. Whichever side took the last turn of the previous round must let the opposing side act first on the next round. Some effects, especially environmental effects, do something at the end of the round. Once all characters have taken their turns, these effects should be resolved before the next round begins.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <h3 id=\"advanced-turn-rules\">Advanced Turn Rules</h3>\n\n  <p>The above rules cover the majority of combat situations, but these rules clarify how turns work in more unusual circumstances. If one side of the combatants includes both players and NPCs, the players should decide when the NPCs on their side take their turns as if they were also player characters. If a combat includes three or more groups with mutually competing goals, the GM may decide to form three or more sides taking turns in order. Some powerful creatures, especially legendary foes, may take multiple turns in a single round. If they fight alongside lesser minions, then they may choose to take their turns back to back after the players’ near the start of the round, or let their minions act first and use their multiple turns in succession toward then end of the round.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"defense\">Defense</h2>\n\n<p>The most common goal of combat is to <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"damage-defeat\" data-path=\"combat/damage-defeat\">defeat</a> one’s enemies, and that is achieved by reducing an enemy’s defense to zero. Defense describes a character’s ability to continue fighting and defending themselves. For player characters and elite or legendary enemies, defense is the combination of the character’s poise, momentum, and focus.</p>\n<h4 id=\"poise\">Poise</h4>\n\n<p>Poise describes a character’s precise balance and control of their weapons and fighting stance. Skills that spend poise require precise coordination, while skills that gain poise let the character readjust their balance. Taking poise damage means being knocked off balance or being forced into an awkward position, and fighting atop a swaying bridge might cause a character to lose poise.\nA character’s base poise is equal to five plus five times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"agility\" data-path=\"abilities/agility\">agility</a>. When a character’s poise is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reeling\" data-path=\"combat/reeling\">reeling</a>, weakening all their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attacks</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"momentum\">Momentum</h4>\n\n<p>Momentum describes how much physical force a character can put into their movements. A skill that slams down into the ground might cost momentum, while a skill that lets a character surge forward might grant momentum. Effects that slam, push, or buffet a character, like a mace blow or howling winds, might damage or reduce a character’s momentum.\nA character’s base momentum is equal to five plus five times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"brawn\" data-path=\"abilities/brawn\">brawn</a>. When a character’s momentum is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"knocked-down\" data-path=\"combat/knocked-down\">knocked-down</a>, preventing them from moving.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"focus\">Focus</h4>\n\n<p>Focus represents a character’s awareness of themselves, other character in the battle, and the battlefield itself. <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"skill\" data-path=\"skill\">Skills</a> that require intense attention will cost focus, but skills that gain focus only take a fleeting thought. Anything that draws a character’s attention away from the battle will deplete their focus, including an enemy’s projectile or a booming explosion.\nA character’s base focus is equal to five plus five times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"insight\" data-path=\"abilities/insight\">insight</a>. When a character’s focus is reduces to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"confused\" data-path=\"combat/confused\">confused</a>, making them just as likely to target allies as enemies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-defense\">Using Defense</h3>\n\n<p>Under normal circumstances, a character begins combat at their base poise, base momentum, and base focus. A character’s base poise is equal to four plus four times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"agility\" data-path=\"abilities/agility\">agility</a>, their base momentum is equal to four plus four times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"brawn\" data-path=\"abilities/brawn\">brawn</a>, and their base focus is equal to four plus four times their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"insight\" data-path=\"abilities/insight\">insight</a>.\nMany skills allow characters to gain defense, and a character may gain defense above their base value. However, practically all of these are noisy, obvious, and threatening to any enemies nearby. Even in the absence of apparent enemies, the GM may add <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"doom\" data-path=\"playing/doom\">doom</a> to the pool if players dally to gain defense in dangerous territory. When the adrenaline of combat fades, typically after about a minute, the characters’ poise momentum and focus return to their base values.\nWhen a character’s poise, momentum, or focus are reduced to zero, typically by enemy attacks, they begin to suffer major setbacks. When a character’s poise is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reeling\" data-path=\"combat/reeling\">reeling</a>. A character who’s momentum is reduced to zero becomes <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"knocked-down\" data-path=\"combat/knocked-down\">knocked-down</a>. And if a character’s focus is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"confused\" data-path=\"combat/confused\">confused</a>. Reeling, knocked-down, and confused are explained in the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"damage-defeat\" data-path=\"combat/damage-defeat\">Damage &amp; Defeat</a> section below.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"minions-defense\">Minions’ Defense</h3>\n\n<p>Many weaker NPCs, called minions, do not have poise, momentum, or focus. Instead, they simply have defense, which represents all three together. Whenever a minion would gain or lose poise, momentum or focus, their defense is adjusted by that amount instead.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"attacking--defending\">Attacking &amp; Defending</h2>\n\n<p>When a character is targeted by an attack, they are given a choice between mitigating the attack or yielding the attack. Mitigating the attack means directly applying the threat of the attack as damage to the target’s choice of poise, momentum, or focus. In contrast, yielding an attack means accepting the yield of the attack. An attack’s yield often does a random amount of damage to a specific kind of defense (specified by the attack) along with other negative consequences. Mitigating an attack is often more costly than yielding, but it is more reliable, and the defender has more choice in which kind of defense is damaged. \nMitigating with poise is called dodging, mitigating with momentum is called blocking, and mitigating with focus is called predicting. A character can only mitigate an attack if they can take the threat as damage to the chosen pool without the pool being depleted. For example, a character with 8 momentum and 2 armor could block  an attack with 9 threat, but not one with 10 threat. If a character can’t block, dodge or predict an attack, they have no choice but to yield to it.\nEffects of the attack take place regardless of any other decisions of the attacker or the defender. Whether the attack is mitigated or yielded, the effects are usually resolved first (though still after the user spends or gains defense). If the attack is an action, the fate dice will be rolled, which may cause the action to become  <a href=\"combat.md#Fated--Doomed-Actions\"></a>, as described below.\nRegardless of weather they mitigate or yield the attack, the damage dealt by it is reduced by the character’s armor, down to a minimum of 0. Some attacks may deal damage to multiple defense types or from multiple sources. In that case, the defender’s armor should only be applied once to the total damage dealt, not each instance of damage. However, the defender may choose which defense damage their armor prevents. Likewise, the attack may choose which defense damage is boosted by their brawn or insight.\nIf an attack reduces a character poise momentum or focus to zero, excess damage carries over into another defense of the defender’s choice. If all three pools are reduced to zero, that character is defeated and excess damage carries over to the character’s stress.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"damage--defeat\">Damage &amp; Defeat</h2>\n\n<p>Having a defense pool reduced to zero is a serious setback that can quickly lead to a character’s defeat if not managed. When a character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"poise\" data-path=\"combat/poise\">poise</a> falls to zero, they are <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reeling\" data-path=\"combat/reeling\">reeling</a>, when their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a> is reduced to zero, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"knocked-down\" data-path=\"combat/knocked-down\">knocked-down</a>, and when their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"focus\" data-path=\"combat/focus\">focus</a> is depleted, they become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"confused\" data-path=\"combat/confused\">confused</a>. Characters should consider the rearm, rise-up, and refocus actions to get back in fighting shape. Whenever damage reduces a character’s poise, momentum, or agility to zero, any remaining damage is dealt to another defense type of their choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reeling\">Reeling</h3>\n\n<p>A reeling character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"poise\" data-path=\"combat/poise\">poise</a> has been reduce to zero, leaving them in a treacherous position. While reeling, a character:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Can’t gain poise</li>\n  <li>Has their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"zone-of-control\" data-path=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone of control</a> suppressed.</li>\n  <li>Suffers a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"bane\" data-path=\"skills/bane\">bane</a> on all their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attacks</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <h4 id=\"optional-rule\">Optional Rule:</h4>\n\n  <p>When a character becomes reeling, they are immediately disarmed as well.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"knocked-down\">Knocked-Down</h3>\n\n  <p>A knocked-down character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a> has been reduce to zero, leaving them immobile on the ground. While knocked-down, a character:</p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Can’t gain momentum</li>\n    <li>Has their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"zone-of-control\" data-path=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone of control</a> suppressed.</li>\n    <li>Cannot move except with the crawl skill</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h4 id=\"optional-rule-1\">Optional Rule:</h4>\n\n  <p>Melee attacks against a knocked-down character gain a boon.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"confused\">Confused</h3>\n\n  <p>A confused character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"focus\" data-path=\"combat/focus\">focus</a> has been reduced to zero, and they have lost track of the battle around them. While confused, a character:</p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Can’t gain focus</li>\n    <li>Has their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"zone-of-control\" data-path=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone of control</a> suppressed.</li>\n    <li>Must target a random character or location they can see within range with all <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"skill\" data-path=\"skill\">skills</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h4 id=\"optional-rule-2\">Optional Rule:</h4>\n\n  <p>When a character becomes confused, they are immediately interrupted as well, and they can’t concentrate on skills.</p>\n  <h3 id=\"defeated\">Defeated</h3>\n\n  <p>Unless combatants flee or come to terms, combat will end in the defeat of one side or the other. A defeated character has had their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"focus\" data-path=\"combat/focus\">focus</a>, <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a> and <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"poise\" data-path=\"combat/poise\">poise</a> all reduced to zero, and is out of the fight. The remainder of any damage dealt beyond their current defense is dealt directly to their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"stress\" data-path=\"stress\">stress</a> instead.\nA defeated character is still conscious and can still talk, but they can’t take any <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">actions</a> or <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reaction\" data-path=\"skills/reaction\">reactions</a>, can’t gain poise, momentum or focus, and the only maneuver they can use is to crawl one space. If they continue to take damage, their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"stress\" data-path=\"stress\">stress</a> is increased by the damage dealt and they may begin to suffer afflictions.\nThe defeated character can recuperate from being defeated if they or another character spend 10 minutes tending to their wounds and restoring their strength. Once a character is no longer defeated, their poise momentum and focus are restored to their base values and they are ready to fight again. Being defeated doesn’t inherently carry any penalties. However, any stress and afflictions may linger for days, until a character has a chance to recover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"movement--position\">Movement &amp; Position</h2>\n\n<p>Moving around the battlefield is the surest way to gain the upper hand on your enemies and ensure you are positioned where you’re most effective. Movement is counted in spaces, where one space is equivalent to about 5 feet or 1½ meters.\nThe most reliable way to get from place to place is the dash maneuver, which allows a character to move 3 spaces plus their <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"bonus-speed\" data-path=\"abilities/bonus-speed\">bonus speed</a>. However, using most <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"maneuver\" data-path=\"skills/maneuver\">maneuvers</a>, like dash, in an enemy’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"zone-of-control\" data-path=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone of control</a> carries a risk of being <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"hinder\" data-path=\"combat/hinder\">hindered</a>, as described below. Another movement option available to character is the step maneuver, which lets a character move exactly 1 space. Since it has the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"careful\" data-path=\"skills/careful\">careful</a> tag, it can ’t be hindered. Finally, the sprint reaction lets a character trade <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a> for a burst of speed.\nWhenever a character moves, there are a few rules that must be followed. A character can move freely through another friendly character’s space, but not an enemy’s. A character can’t end their turn in another character’s space; if two characters somehow find themselves in the same space at the end of a turn, the GM will move one of them into an adjacent space.\nA character moving diagonally pays one space of movement the first time they move diagonally on a turn, then two spaces for the next time they move diagonally, repeating that pattern as they continue to move diagonally. A character can’t move diagonally if the movement would cut through an impassable obstacle or a hostile character’s space. Characters must typically finish one skill before starting another; a character can’t move a few spaces with a maneuver, use an <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a>, then finish the rest of the maneuver’s movement.\nA character can use three spaces of movement to do other things relating to movement, like opening or closing a door or mounting a horse, or becoming <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"kneeling\" data-path=\"conditions/kneeling\">kneeling</a>. A character swimming, climbing, or moving into certain types of <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"special-terrain\" data-path=\"special-terrain\">special terrain</a> must spend two movement points to move one space.\nSome effects may reduce a character’s speed to zero. Such a character still benefits from moving spaces specified by a skill, but never adds their speed to the total distance moved. Other effects prevent movement entirely, including preventing moving spaces specified by a skill.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>Optional Rule: Back to back fighting Fighting back to back with an ally can give both of you the chance to coordinate the perfect strike or foil your foe’s attacks with a combined defense. If your group chooses to use this rule, then whenever you begin your turn adjacent to at least one ally, you gain +2 poise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"zone-of-control\">Zone of Control</h3>\n\n<p>A character’s zone of control, often abbreviated as “ZoC” is the area of the battlefield where they can interfere with an enemy’s movements and <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"ranged\" data-path=\"skills/ranged\">ranged</a> <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt;. Any ranged action used while in an enemy’s zone of control suffers a &lt;a href=\" data-path=\"actions\">actions</a>. Any ranged action used while in an enemy’s zone of control suffers a <a href=\"skills/bane\">bane</a>. A character’s zone of control also determines where they can <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"hinder\" data-path=\"combat/hinder\">hinder</a> <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; and when they have an enemy &lt;a href=\" data-path=\"maneuvers\">maneuvers</a> and when they have an enemy <a href=\"combat/surrounded\">surrounded</a>.\nA character armed with a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"weapon\" data-path=\"equipment/weapon\">weapon</a> with the ZoC tag, typically a weapon used for melee combat, has a zone of control that includes their own space and all spaces adjacent to them. A character who isn’t armed with a ZoC weapon doesn’t normally have a zone of control. A character’s zone of control may be temporarily suppressed if they are <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"knocked-down\" data-path=\"combat/knocked-down\">knocked-down</a>, <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reeling\" data-path=\"combat/reeling\">reeling</a>, confused, <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; affected by certain other &lt;a href=\" data-path=\"or\">or</a> affected by certain other <a href=\"conditions\">conditions</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hindering-maneuvers\">Hindering Maneuvers</h3>\n\n<p>Using most <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"maneuver\" data-path=\"skills/maneuver\">maneuvers</a> while engaged with the enemy is risky. While a character is using any maneuver in a hostile character’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"zone-of-control\" data-path=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone-of-control</a>, the hostile character can use a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reaction\" data-path=\"skills/reaction\">reaction</a> to hinder the maneuvering character. A character may enter a hostile character’s zone of control without being hindered, but using a maneuver to move from within an enemy zone of control allows that enemy to hinder the character. A skill with the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"careful\" data-path=\"skills/careful\">careful</a> tag cannot be hindered.\nWhen a character is hindered, they immediately lose -2 <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"poise\" data-path=\"combat/poise\">poise</a>, -2 <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a>, and -2 <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"focus\" data-path=\"combat/focus\">focus</a>. Hindering is not an attack; no contest is involved, no ability bonuses added, and the hindered character doesn’t benefit from <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"armor\" data-path=\"abilities/armor\">armor</a>.\nHowever much distance a character moves or however many maneuvers they use, a character can only be hindered by each enemy once on a turn. However, a character may be hindered by many enemies if they use a maneuver in multiple enemies’ zones of control.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrounded\">Surrounded</h3>\n\n<p>A character may become surrounded if they have multiple enemies or obstacles closing off their retreat. <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">Attack</a> <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skill/action\">actions</a> against a surrounded character gain a <a href=\"skills/boon\">boon</a>.\nIn simple terms, a character is surrounded if they can’t leave an enemy’s <a href=\"zone%20of%20control\">zone of control</a>. More precisely, a character is surrounded if they are within the zone of control of one or more enemies, and every adjacent space into which they could move is also within the zone of control of at least one of those enemies. A character is also surrounded if they have two enemies with active zones of control on directly opposite corners of them.\nEven if a character can’t move, or could teleport, the adjacent spaces into which they could hypothetically move should be considered. If an obstacle prevents movement into a space, that space doesn’t need to be in an enemy’s zone of control for a character to be surrounded. A character is not surrounded as long as they could leave the zones of control they are currently in, even if it means moving into someone else’s zone of control. Since characters can move into the space of a friendly character, a space occupied by a friendly character doesn’t count against a character to determine if they are surrounded unless it is also in an enemy’s zone of control.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"size\">Size</h3>\n\n<p>A character’s size describes how big they are and how much space they take up. A normal human’s size is one. A character with a size larger than one takes up a square with each side made of spaces equal to their size, so a size three character takes up a three by three square, or nine spaces in total.\nSmaller character are described as fractions, such as 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and so on. Such creatures normally still take up one entire space, but the GM may allow characters of significantly different sizes to share a space. Different sizes don’t come with any inherent bonuses or penalties, but may become relevant for certain skills or the grabbed condition.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cover\">Cover</h3>\n\n<p>A character might have cover against a skill if an obstacle or another character partially blocks their line of sight. Attacks, support actions, ranged actions, and melee actions might all be penalized by cover if something is in the way. Specifically, any <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a> that passes through a space containing an obstacle or another character suffers a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"bane\" data-path=\"skills/bane\">bane</a>. The obstacle might be a tree, a corner, a low wall, or anything else that would partially block the view of the target. Remember that a skill can’t normally target a character that the user can’t see at all.\nIf the nature of the cover allows it, a character can pop out from behind cover, attack, then duck back into cover all on their turn. However, if a character must move by at least one space to emerge from cover, such as running around a corner, they won’t typically be able to move back into their old space on the same turn.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"high-ground\">High Ground</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <h3 id=\"optional-rule-advanced-high-ground\">Optional Rule: Advanced High Ground</h3>\n\n  <p>Holding the high ground can be a tremendous advantage, and taking or relinquishing the high ground can be a major decision if your group decides to use these rules. Moving up by one space either costs -2 <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a> per space ascended or twice as many movement points. However, descending by a space grants +2 momentum per space descended. A gradual slope may require moving laterally several spaces to ascend or descend one space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When a character is standing on higher ground than their target (typically by at least 3 feet / 1 meter, but up to GM discretion) when making a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"melee\" data-path=\"skills/melee\">melee</a> <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attack\" data-path=\"skills/attack\">attack</a> <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a>, then the attack gains a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"boon\" data-path=\"skills/boon\">boon</a>. However, if a melee attack is made from lower ground than the target, it suffers a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"bane\" data-path=\"skills/bane\">bane</a>. A character using a ranged skill from higher ground adds the height difference to the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"ranged\" data-path=\"skills/ranged\">range</a> of the skill.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mounted-combat\">Mounted Combat</h3>\n\n<p>Fighting from atop a horse or even a mythical flying beast can convey a huge advantage. In order to serve as a mount, a creature needs to be at least one <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"size\" data-path=\"combat/size\">size</a> category larger than the character riding it. The creature must be willing, and many creatures require a saddle, harness, or other equipment to be ridden properly. \nClimbing onto or off a mount requires three movement points. Whenever the mount moves, you move with it. While mounted, you and your mount share all the mount’s spaces. That means you can use <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; as if you where in any of the mount’s spaces, but skills can also target you if they target any of the mount’s spaces. If you have a normal &lt;a class=\" data-path=\"skill\">skills</a> as if you where in any of the mount’s spaces, but skills can also target you if they target any of the mount’s spaces. If you have a normal <a href=\"combat/zone-of-control\">zone of control</a>, then all spaces adjacent to the mount are within your zone of control. If an enemy <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"hinder\" data-path=\"combat/hinder\">hinders</a> the mount’s movement, they may hinder either you or the mount. \nWhile mounted, you use the mount’s <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"momentum\" data-path=\"combat/momentum\">momentum</a> as if it were your own. Skills and effects that cause you to gain or lose momentum or take momentum damage cause the mount to gain or lose momentum or take damage instead. If either you or the mount are <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"shove\" data-path=\"combat/shove\">shoved</a>, <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"kneeling\" data-path=\"conditions/kneeling\">kneeling</a>, or <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"knocked-down\" data-path=\"combat/knocked-down\">knocked-down</a>, you fall from the mount and your momentum is reduced to 4 if it was higher. If you dismount intentionally, your momentum returns to what it was before you mounted the creature.\nIf the mount has only animal intelligence, like a horse, then you must use your turn to command it. Instead of your <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"maneuver\" data-path=\"skills/maneuver\">maneuver</a>, the mount may use a maneuver, and instead of your <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"action\" data-path=\"skills/action\">action</a>, the mount may use an action. It doesn’t use actions or maneuvers unless you use yours to command it. If the mount has any <a href=\"reactions\">reactions</a>, you may choose to use them whenever their requirements are met. Such mounts are not perfect, and may disobey you if they are put in very unusual situations.\nIf the mount is reasonably intelligent, then it acts on its own, taking its own turn during combat and using its own actions and maneuvers. You may use your actions and maneuvers independently while mounted, although you still share the mount’s momentum.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"combat-in-water-wip\">Combat in Water [WIP]</h3>\n\n<p>Fighting while swimming can be extremely difficult for anyone unprepared. Moving while swimming requires two movement points for every space moved. While swimming in water, a character becomes <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"wet\" data-path=\"conditions/wet\">wet</a>, and if the wet condition is removed they instantly become wet again. Spaces of water also count as <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"wet-terrain\" data-path=\"special-terrain/wet-terrain\">wet-terrain</a>. All <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; made while swimming suffer a &lt;a href=\" data-path=\"actions\">actions</a> made while swimming suffer a <a href=\"skills/bane\">bane</a>, unless they are made with dagger or spear weapons, or they have the water or aquatic tag.\nUnless a character can breathe underwater, they may become <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"choking\" data-path=\"conditions/choking\">choking</a> if they don’t hold their breath before plunging into the water. A character who holds their breath must follow the breath holding rules outlined above. While underwater, medium and long ranged skills are reduced to short-ranged. Fire and audible skills are ineffective if the user or target is underwater, as are ranged attacks from gun weapons. A character in a moving body of water may be carried along with the flow at the end of the combat round.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"order-of-resolution-wip\">Order of Resolution [WIP]</h2>\n\n<p>Some skills, attack, support or otherwise, will offer the user, the target, or both a choice about what happens.

{"name":"Equipment","flags":{"forgeoflegends":{"path":"equipment/equipment"}},"pages":[{"name":"Equipment","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div title=\"Equipment\">\n\t<h1 id=\"equipment\">Equipment</h1>\n\n<p>Whether it is a character’s armor, specialized equipment that grants unique abilities, useful tools like a 10-foot pole, or simply the supplies needed to survive, having the right items can make the difference between success and failure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"equipment-slots\">Equipment Slots</h2>\n\n<p>The number and type of items a character can equip is limited by their equipment slots. A character benefits from all their equipped items and, can change their equipment by adjusting their fighting style, as described above. A character wearing too many pieces of equipment in the same slot can’t benefit from any of them properly. A character wearing more armor than their brawn allows suffers the encumbered condition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"weapons\">Weapons</h3>\n\n<p>A character can equip four “hands” of weapons, meaning four one-handed weapons, two one-handed weapons and one two-handed weapon, or two two-handed weapons. Weapons can range from sword to bows to shield to magic wands. For a complete list of weapons and their associated abilities, see the Weapon List chapter below.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"head\">Head</h3>\n\n<p>Helmets, hats, headbands, and goggles are all considered head equipment. Head equipment often make the biggest impression, as described below. Head equipment is also useful for granting and protecting a character’s sight and hearing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"shoulder\">Shoulder</h3>\n\n<p>Cloaks, backpacks, scarves, and pauldrons can all be equipped to a character’s shoulder slot. Such items can have a wide variety of effects, from protecting against the elements, to resisting conditions, to making a dramatic impression.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"chest\">Chest</h3>\n\n<p>The most common chest equipment is a suit of armor, which increases the character’s armor number and protects against attacks. Many suits of armor cover other parts of the body, but they are still considered chest slot equipment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"feet\">Feet</h3>\n\n<p>Boots, shoes, and sandals will often affect how a character moves or interacts with special terrain. A good pair of boots might also help with a long overland journey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"accessories\">Accessories</h3>\n\n<p>A character can equip two accessories, such, such as rings, gloves, belts, bracers, or pendants. Such items are rarely useful in combat unless they are legendary, but they may have effects relating exploration, talent rolls, or influence rolls.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pockets\">Pockets</h3>\n\n<p>Pockets are unique in that a character doesn’t default have any pocket slots. Instead, pocket slots are often granted by other equipment and characters may have multiple. Items small enough to fit in a pocket slot could be anything from a small knife to a consumable potion.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"impression\">Impression</h2>\n\n<p>What a person wears can say a lot about them, whether they want it to or not. In addition to an equipment’s slot, many pieces of equipment also have an impression, describing how others perceive that equipment. Equipment impression is described in the same terms as the six personality traits (bold, subtle, idealistic, pragmatic, serious, &amp; carefree), including a rating. However, there are some important differences.</p>\n\n<p>For one, equipment’s impression doesn’t change the person wearing it, only how they are perceived. Impressions only affect influence rolls, not legendary deeds or any other effects based on personality. The equipment an NPC is wearing also doesn’t affect how they will respond to influence rolls made by the player character or other NPCs.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, while a character’s equipment may have many different impression ratings, only the highest impression rating matters, and influence rolls are only altered by one point at the most. Characters should add together all impression ratings from their equipment. Impression ratings associated with opposite traits cancel out and are subtracted from each other when determining the overall highest.</p>\n\n<p>Whichever impression rating is highest across the character’s equipment is the overall impression their appearance makes. Whenever the character makes an influence roll, their personality is treated as if it that trait rating was one point higher (possibly higher than three), or the opposing trait was one point lower. If multiple impression ratings are tied for the highest, then the character’s equipment doesn’t make a strong impression and their influence rolls are not modified.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"inventory\">Inventory</h2>\n\n<p>A character’s inventory describes everything else they might be carrying, including food, water, torches, weapon ammunition, a bedroll, and a backpack to carry it all. Any item has two important attributes, its bulk, describing how heavy and ungainly it is to carry, and its price describing how expensive it is.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bulk\">Bulk</h3>\n\n<p>Bulk is an abstract description of how heavy an item is and how hard it is to carry, some items like a lead ball might be bulky simply because of how heavy they are, while others like a 10-foot pole might be bulky because there are awkward to store.\nIn general, one bulk equates to about five pounds or two and a half kilograms. A character’s carrying capacity is terms of bulk is equal to four plus double their brawn, so a character with two brawn could carry eight bulk, about 40 pounds or 20 kg. A character may attempt to carry up to double that amount, but doing so imposes the encumbered condition on the character. A character can’t reliably carry more than double their carrying capacity over long distances. Over short distances, see the rules for lifting and dragging below.\nItems that weight less that one bulk don’t typically need to be counted against the limit a character can carry. If a character tries to carry many small items, the GM may say that several of those small items make up one bulk.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"currency\">Currency</h3>\n\n<p>In the fantasy world of Forge of Legends, most people buy and sell things using coins of copper, silver or gold. More expensive transactions may instead require entire bars of precious metal. Gemstones, land, or other property may be traded, but aren’t considered money.\n| Currency  Exchance Rates |              |              |            |             |             |           |\n| ———————— | ———— | ———— | ———- | ———– | ———– | ——— |\n| Currency                 | Copper Coins | Silver Coins | Gold Coins | Copper Bars | Silver Bars | Gold Bars |\n| Copper Coins             | 1            | 1/10         | 1/100      | 1/1,000     | 10,000      | 1/100,000 |\n| Silver Coins             | 10           | 1            | 1/10       | 1/100       | 1/1,000     | 10,000    |\n| Gold Coins               | 100          | 10           | 1          | 1/10        | 1/100       | 1/1,000   |\n| Copper Bars              | 1,000        | 100          | 10         | 1           | 1/10        | 1/100     |\n| Silver Bars              | 10,000       | 1,000        | 100        | 10          | 1           | 1/10      |\n| Gold Bars                | 100,000      | 10,000       | 1,000      | 100         | 10          | 1         |</p>\n\n<p>Each denomination of coin is worth 10 times as much as the previous denomination. A copper bar is worth 10 times as much as gold coin, and silver and gold are each 10 times more valuable again than the previous denomination. These exchange rates are shown in the table below. Copper coins, silver coins, and gold coins are often called copper, silver, or gold for short. Something only refers to a “bar” if the word is used, otherwise coins are the default.</p>\n\n<p>All coins weigh 1/50th of a pound (1/100th kg), while each bar weighs 20 pounds (10 kg). Players don’t typically need to track the weight of coins they are carrying, but each bar takes up four bulk.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, merchants will usually accept any combination of coins and bars that meet the price required to pay for an item. Most people would rather receive 50 gold coins than 5 copper bars.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"price\">Price</h3>\n\n<p>An item’s price describes how much someone would typically pay for it. Prices are listed only in terms of their general category - Copper, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Gemstones.</p>\n\n<p>The price of an item describes how much that item is typically worth. Prices are listed in vague ranges of “a few” or “several” of each of the different kinds of currency. For example, a meal at an inn might cost “a few copper (coins),” a good set of clothes might cost “several silver (coins)”, and a sailing ship might cost “a few gold bars.”</p>\n\n<p>These vague terms reflect the fact that the price of an item may vary. Several factors, such as local availability, demand, or regulations, can influence the price an item will actually cost. An item that costs “a few” coins or bars might cost between one and five, while an item that costs “several” coins or bars would cost between six to ten. Extreme surplus or shortage might even shift an item’s price category.</p>\n\n<p>When a player asks the price of an item, The GM may take the opportunity to set the price in the low or high range of the price category in a way the represents the local availability and values. Alternatively, the GM may simply say that any item that costs “a few” costs three, while any item that costs “several” costs seven.</p>\n\n<p>When a character wants to sell an item from their inventory, it will almost always sell at the bottom of the item’s price range; only one or two for “a few,” and six or seven for “several”. Legendary items have no standard price, they can be sold for whatever people are willing to pay.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"supplies\">Supplies</h3>\n\n<p>Supplies represent everything an adventurer might use up on a regular basis. This includes food, torches, ammunition, flint and tinder for starting fires, as well as tools for cleaning and maintaining weapons and equipment.</p>\n\n<p>In Forge of Legends, all of those mundane consumables are described by a single item simply called supplies. As long as a character has at least one supply, they have everything they need to keep adventuring for the day.</p>\n\n<p>Supplies cost a few silver and take up one bulk. Characters should stock up on as many supplies as they want to carry while they are in town. Each evening before they rest, characters must remove one supply from their inventory, representing the resources used throughout the day. If a character spends a relaxing day in civilization, they may not need to consume supplies if they purchase food and accommodations.</p>\n\n<p>Supplies notably don’t include water. In most parts of the world, water is easy to come by. But in places where water is scarce, adventurers should consider bringing their own. One day’s quantity of water for a person, including a typical container, takes up one bulk.</p>\n\n<p>When character’s run out of supplies, they may begin to suffer from hunger (see the Stress &amp; Affliction chapter below), they may be unable to use weapons requiring ammunition, including bows and guns, they may struggle to find their way through darkness, and they may be unable to repair damaged equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Pockets may be used either to carry one pocket slot item, or to carry an item with a bulk of one.</p>\n\n<p>When a character’s supplies are depleted to one, they are running low on something. The GM may decide weaher they are running low on food, ammo, or tools to maintain their equipment. A character running low on food begins to accumulate stress at a rate of</p>\n\n<p>A character running low on maintaince tools has their actions and ability rolls become doomed on a roll 1 higher, typically when the die rolls either 1 or 2 instead of just one</p>\n\n<p>Non-elemental alchemy:</p>\n\n<p>Oil of Brawn\nMelee attack actions deal +2 damage\nGain +1 Armor</p>\n\n<p>Oil of Agility\nAttacks with this weapon gain +1 threat\nGain +1 Speed</p>\n\n<p>Oil of Focus\nGain +1 focus after using one of this weapon’s actions\nGain +1 Fated Action Threshold</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"item-tags\">Item Tags</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"one-handed\">One-Handed</h3>\n\n<p>A one-hand weapon only requires one hand to use properly. Characters can wield two one-handed weapons at once, and equip up to four in their fighting style.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"two-handed\">Two-Handed</h3>\n\n<p>A two-hand weapon requires both hands to use properly. Characters may only wield one two-handed weapon at a time, and can equip two two-handed weapons in their fighting style. A character may carry a two-handed weapon in just one hand, but cannot use any of the weapons skills while doing do.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"zoc\">ZoC</h3>\n\n<p>A ZoC weapon is typically used for close combat and grants the character wielding it a zone of control. Zones of control are useful for hindering enemy maneuvers and surrounding them. Note that some situations may prevent a character from having a zone of control even while they wield a ZoC weapon.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reloading\">Reloading</h3>\n\n<p>A reloading weapon needs to be reloaded after using a ranged skill. Whenever one of the weapons ranged skills is used, it becomes unloaded, and it can’t use any ranged skills while it is unloaded. The weapon may still be used for non-ranged skills even while unloaded.</p>\n\n<p>All reloading weapons come with the basic reload skill, which may be used to reload the weapon. Additionally, while a character has a reloading weapon equipped in their fighting style, they may also equip one reloading skill as a bonus skill.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"damaged\">Damaged</h3>\n\n<p>A damaged item is not functioning properly. It imposes a bane on any skills or ability rolls associated with the it. Equipment that normally grants armor grants one fewer point of armor while damaged. Damaged items may be repaired during a 10-minute rest.</p>\n \n</div>"},"_id":"16RHmk6OTGZhAaZ2","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273483940,"modifiedTime":1668273483940,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"yeiFGyelaAqciEB2"}

Heroes, especially those who stay true to themselves and to their friends, often find that destiny is on their side. In Forge of Legends, fate is a system for rewarding players for expressing their characters’ personality, and for giving players some control over the game world beyond the actions of their characters.\nPlayers will gain fate through fateful deeds: momentous decisions which are described in the <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"personality\" data-path=\"personality\">Personality</a> section. Characters also gain fate whenever one of their background details poses a significant obstacle to themselves or the group, as determined by the GM. Some GMs may choose to award fate points to players who make the game more fun for everyone, such as taking an amazing risk or spouting an exceptional joke.\nWhen a player earns a fate point, they should add it to their total number and keep track of them. Each player may save up to 3 fate points at a time. If a player already has 3 fate points when they earn another, they may give their new fate point to another player instead.  Note that fate points belong to an individual player, not merely their character. Players may gain and spend fate points even in situations where their character is not present, if the GM deems it appropriate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"twists-of-fate\">Twists of Fate</h2>\n\n<p>Players may spend their fate points by invoking a twist of fate at any time to add detail to the game world. Some common twists of fate would be: adding a feature to the environment, adding an item to their character’s inventory, or embellishing their character’s background, all of which may add bonuses or penalties. Any detail, no matter the subject and no matter how large or small, can be invoked by a twist of fate. However, players may only add detail, not remove or change details that have already been established.\nWhen a player declares that they would like to invoke a twist of fate, they should describe the detail they would like to add to the world. The game master then decides if that detail could reasonably exist, and if it hasn’t already been established. If so, the player may spend their fate point and the detail they suggested is added to the game world. Alternatively, a successful <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"challenge\" data-path=\"playing/challenge\">challenge</a> might allow a player to invoke a twist of fate for free!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"doom\">Doom</h2>\n\n<p>The doom pool represents long term complications that impose obstacles between them and their goals. Many things can generate doom, such as failing challenges, dawdling in dangerous locales, and the machinations of the villains. The GM Guidelines section dictates how the GM can use doom, but it will always be used to cause problems for the players. Players should try their best to minimize the amount of doom the GM accrues.</p>\n \n</div>"},"_id":"LaoOPi3VeTAOzJib","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273484020,"modifiedTime":1668273484020,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"zSaw5tZQI4IMul4F"}

That first acting character takes the first turn of combat. Any other characters may use a <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"reaction\" data-path=\"skills/reaction\">reaction</a> to immediately draw any <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"weapon\" data-path=\"skills/weapon\">weapons</a> they have equipped.\nA character may use two <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"a&gt; on their turn, one &lt;a class=\" data-path=\"skill\">skills</a> on their turn, one <a href=\"skills/action\">action</a> and one <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"maneuver\" data-path=\"skills/maneuver\">maneuver</a>. Actions typically involve <a class=\"keyword\" title=\"attacking\" data-path=\"combat/attacking\">attacking</a> enemies or supporting allies, while maneuvers typically involve moving to a better location or preparing for another skill. A character may use reactions on their own turn, as well as during other characters’ turns. Characters must typically finish one action before starting another; a character can’t move a few spaces with a maneuver, use an action, then finish the rest of the maneuver’s movement.\nOnce a character has finished their turn, an enemy character takes a turn. Typically, combat will occur between the group player characters and one group of NPCs controlled by the GM. When an enemy NPC finishes a turn, the players will collaborate to choose one of their characters who has not yet acted to take the next turn. When a player character finishes their turn, the GM will choose one NPC combatant who has not taken a turn to take the next turn. This cycle continues until all characters have taken their turns.\nIf all characters on one side have taken their turns, and other characters on the enemy side have not, then the other side may take their turns back to back until all characters have taken a turn. Once the last character in the combat has taken their turn, the round ends. Whichever side took the last turn of the previous round must let the opposing side act first on the next round. Some effects, especially environmental effects, do something at the end of the round. Once all characters have taken their turns, these effects should be resolved before the next round begins.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n  <h3 id=\"advanced-turn-rules\">Advanced Turn Rules</h3>\n\n  <p>The above rules cover the majority of combat situations, but these rules clarify how turns work in more unusual circumstances. If one side of the combatants includes both players and NPCs, the players should decide when the NPCs on their side take their turns as if they were also player characters. If a combat includes three or more groups with mutually competing goals, the GM may decide to form three or more sides taking turns in order. Some powerful creatures, especially legendary foes, may take multiple turns in a single round. If they fight alongside lesser minions, then they may choose to take their turns back to back after the players’ near the start of the round, or let their minions act first and use their multiple turns in succession toward then end of the round.</p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"pa2i8aei0bbx4Bsp","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cZY121Eik0C03v39":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"forgeoflegends","systemVersion":"0.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668273484640,"modifiedTime":1668273484640,"lastModifiedBy":"cZY121Eik0C03v39"},"_id":"zTf98udGJqsiVvxC"}
