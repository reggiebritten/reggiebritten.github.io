<h3 id="challenge-difficulty">Challenge Difficulty</h3>

<p>The GM will assign each challenge a a dice size based on the task’s difficulty. The dice size should be determined by considering how easy the task would be for a normal person under normal circumstances, including any tools or strategy they are using. The dice size should not take into account a character’s expertise or unusual circumstances; those are represented as bonuses or penalties to the roll, as described below.
