<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>The gamemaster will call for a challenge when a character attempts a task where the outcome is in doubt. First the player should describe the task their character will attempt and what they hope to accomplish with it. Next, the GM will determine how easy or difficult the task is, and if any ability or personality trait applies. If the GM decides that the task can’t fail or can’t succeed, it is not a challenge. Finally, the dice will be rolled to determine the outcome.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-difficulty">Challenge Difficulty</h3>

<p>The GM will assign each challenge a a dice size based on the task’s difficulty. The dice size should be determined by considering how easy the task would be for a normal person under normal circumstances, including any tools or strategy they are using. The dice size should not take into account a character’s expertise or unusual circumstances; those are represented as bonuses or penalties to the roll, as described below.

<h3 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</h3>

<p>To determine the outcome of a challenge, roll two dice of the size set by the GM. Compare the result of each die to the character’s score in the ability of the challenge.
If two of the dice are equal to or higher than the TN, the challenge is a success! The player has accomplished their goal. However, if none of the dice exceed the TN, then the challenge is <a href="doomed">doomed</a>! Not only has the attempt failed, it has had additional negative consequences. If exactly one of the dice beats the TN, a mixed success has been rolled. The player must then choose: do they succeed at the task but the challenge becomes  <a href="doomed">doomed</a>? Or do their fail at the task at hand but the challenge becomes <a href="fated">fated</a>?
When a challenge is fated, the player may invoke a twist of fate without spending a fate point. However, the detail added to the world must be somehow related to the nature of the challenge, as determined by the GM. The <a href="GM%20Guidelines">GM Guidelines</a> section has more details on doomed and fated challenges.
A friendly or neutral NPC’s challenges work just like a player’s. However, challenges work slightly differently for hostile or antagonistic NPCs. Whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge would generate a doomed result, then one of the players may invoke a free twist of fate as if they rolled a fated challenge. Conversely, whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge is fated, that generates a doomed effect for the players. The GM will typically choose the player most closely related to the roll to benefit or suffer from NPCs’ fate dice.</p>

<p>&gt;Optional Rule: All or Nothing
&gt;Your group might wish to offer a player the way to raise the stakes of a challenge. At any time you may add a boon to a challenge. However, if less than three dice exceed the TN, then it is automatically doomed as if 0 dice did.</p>

<h3 id="boons--banes">Boons &amp; Banes</h3>

<p>If the character has any background details that would make them significantly more component at this task in specific than they normally are at this type of task, each of those details adds a boon to the challenge. Likewise if there are any unusual circumstances that benefit the character, then each of those adds a boon as well.
For each boon that a character has on a challenge, roll one additional ten-sided die and compare it to the TN. It counts just like the other dice for determining the success of the roll. Furthermore, if three or more dice beat the TN, then the challenge is fated!  Not only has it succeeded, the roll provides additional benefit to the character.
&gt;Which background details are specific enough grant a boon?
&gt;A background detail that could apply to many different challenges is not specific enough to grant a boon. For example, a player might point out that their character is used to sneaking around from their time in the slums, so they should get a boon to sneaking through the forest. However the GM would decide that such a background detail is not specific enough to be relevant to this challenge. On the other hand, if they were sneaking through a city, such a background detail would certainly help.</p>

<p>If the character has any background details that would significantly interfere with their completion of the task, then each of these adds a bane to the challenge. However, the player is awarded a fate point when their background impose a significant hinderance. Having a rich and exciting background tends to pay off in the long term, even when it causes short term complications. Each unusual circumstance that would hider the character also add a bane.
Each bane that a character has cancels out one of their boons for the challenge. If there are any excess banes, each one of those forces the character to roll another ten-sided die. Then, only the lowest two of all the dice are considered for determining the outcome of the roll.
&gt;Sometimes, it is only a matter of time before a character accomplishes their goal, such as thoroughly searching an entire room. In that case, the challenges may represent how long it takes to succeed rather than deciding success or failure. The GM may decide how long an action takes, but the higher the roll, the faster it goes. Spending too much time can come with its own risks, outlined in the <a href="exploration/exploration.md">Exploration</a> section below.</p>

<h3 id="group-challenges">Group Challenges</h3>

<p>Sometimes, multiple characters can cooperate toward resolving a challenge. If the challenge is one than benefits from having multiple characters, then the GM will set the TN based on the contributing character for whom the challenge would be easiest. This might be the the character with the highest relevant ability score, the character with the best tools for the job, or the character with the best plan of action. Some circumstances may also raise or lower the target number of the roll. For example, one person trying to lift a horse might be incredible, but for four people it might only be difficult. However, if the challenge would be hindered by multiple participants, such as sneaking around as a group, then the GM will set the TN based on the character for whom the challenge would be most difficult. 
Next, each coopering character may contribute their relevant background details, granting a boon (or a bane for hindering details) for each. Unusual circumstances that apply boons or banes should be accounted for as well A circumstance only needs to affect one character, not all characters, in order to add a boon or bane, . Finally, one player rolls the dice to determine the result of the entire group. If the challenge becomes mixed, fated or doomed, all participants should collaborate to decide what happens.</p>
