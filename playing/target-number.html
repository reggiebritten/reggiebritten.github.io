<h3 id="target-number-tn">Target Number (TN)</h3>

<p>The GM will assign the challenge a target number, or TN, based on the task’s difficulty. The TN should be determined by considering how easy the task would be for a normal person under normal circumstances, including any tools or strategy they are using. Furthermore, the difficulty is reduced by subtracting the character’s relevant ability score or trait rating from the TN, if applicable. Note that some challenges, such as picking a lock, might not benefit from a character’s abilities or traits. Such challenges would depend on only on the character’s tools and expertise.
If a challenge would be opposed by another character, such as an opponent in a debate or picking a pocket, that opponent’s relevant ability score or personality trait increases the TN. When in doubt about who is making the challenge and who is the opponent, assume the player character is the challenger.
The TN should not take into account a character’s expertise or unusual circumstances; those are represented as boons or banes to the roll, as described below. The “Difficulty” table provides guidelines and examples for target numbers, and additional information for setting target numbers can be found in the <a href="GM%20Guidelines">GM Guidelines</a> section.</p>
