<h3 id="group-challenges">Group Challenges</h3>

<p>Sometimes, multiple characters can cooperate toward resolving a challenge. If the challenge is one than benefits from having multiple characters, then the GM will set the TN based on the contributing character for whom the challenge would be easiest. This might be the the character with the highest relevant ability score, the character with the best tools for the job, or the character with the best plan of action. Some circumstances may also raise or lower the target number of the roll. For example, one person trying to lift a horse might be incredible, but for four people it might only be difficult. However, if the challenge would be hindered by multiple participants, such as sneaking around as a group, then the GM will set the TN based on the character for whom the challenge would be most difficult. 
Next, each coopering character may contribute their relevant background details, granting a boon (or a bane for hindering details) for each. Unusual circumstances that apply boons or banes should be accounted for as well A circumstance only needs to affect one character, not all characters, in order to add a boon or bane, . Finally, one player rolls the dice to determine the result of the entire group. If the challenge becomes mixed, fated or doomed, all participants should collaborate to decide what happens.</p>
