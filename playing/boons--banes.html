<h3 id="boons--banes">Boons &amp; Banes</h3>

<p>If the character has any background details that would make them significantly more component at this task in specific than they normally are at this type of task, each of those details adds a boon to the challenge. Likewise if there are any unusual circumstances that benefit the character, then each of those adds a boon as well.
For each boon that a character has on a challenge, roll one additional ten-sided die and compare it to the TN. It counts just like the other dice for determining the success of the roll. Furthermore, if three or more dice beat the TN, then the challenge is fated!  Not only has it succeeded, the roll provides additional benefit to the character.
&gt;Which background details are specific enough grant a boon?
&gt;A background detail that could apply to many different challenges is not specific enough to grant a boon. For example, a player might point out that their character is used to sneaking around from their time in the slums, so they should get a boon to sneaking through the forest. However the GM would decide that such a background detail is not specific enough to be relevant to this challenge. On the other hand, if they were sneaking through a city, such a background detail would certainly help.</p>

<p>If the character has any background details that would significantly interfere with their completion of the task, then each of these adds a bane to the challenge. However, the player is awarded a fate point when their background impose a significant hinderance. Having a rich and exciting background tends to pay off in the long term, even when it causes short term complications. Each unusual circumstance that would hider the character also add a bane.
Each bane that a character has cancels out one of their boons for the challenge. If there are any excess banes, each one of those forces the character to roll another ten-sided die. Then, only the lowest two of all the dice are considered for determining the outcome of the roll.
&gt;Sometimes, it is only a matter of time before a character accomplishes their goal, such as thoroughly searching an entire room. In that case, the challenges may represent how long it takes to succeed rather than deciding success or failure. The GM may decide how long an action takes, but the higher the roll, the faster it goes. Spending too much time can come with its own risks, outlined in the <a href="exploration/exploration.md">Exploration</a> section below.</p>
