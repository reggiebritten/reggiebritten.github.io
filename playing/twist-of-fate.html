<h2 id="twists-of-fate">Twists of Fate</h2>

<p>Players may spend their fate points by invoking a twist of fate at any time to add detail to the game world. Some common twists of fate would be: adding a feature to the environment, adding an item to their character’s inventory, or embellishing their character’s background, all of which may add bonuses or penalties. Any detail, no matter the subject and no matter how large or small, can be invoked by a twist of fate. However, players may only add detail, not remove or change details that have already been established.
When a player declares that they would like to invoke a twist of fate, they should describe the detail they would like to add to the world. The game master then decides if that detail could reasonably exist, and if it hasn’t already been established. If so, the player may spend their fate point and the detail they suggested is added to the game world. Alternatively, a successful <a href="playing/challenges.md">challenges</a> might allow a player to invoke a twist of fate for free!</p>
