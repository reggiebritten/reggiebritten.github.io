<h3 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</h3>

<p>To determine the outcome of a challenge, roll two dice of the size set by the GM. Compare the result of each die to the character’s score in the ability of the challenge.
If two of the dice are equal to or higher than the TN, the challenge is a success! The player has accomplished their goal. However, if none of the dice exceed the TN, then the challenge is <a href="doomed">doomed</a>! Not only has the attempt failed, it has had additional negative consequences. If exactly one of the dice beats the TN, a mixed success has been rolled. The player must then choose: do they succeed at the task but the challenge becomes  <a href="doomed">doomed</a>? Or do their fail at the task at hand but the challenge becomes <a href="fated">fated</a>?
When a challenge is fated, the player may invoke a twist of fate without spending a fate point. However, the detail added to the world must be somehow related to the nature of the challenge, as determined by the GM. The <a href="GM%20Guidelines">GM Guidelines</a> section has more details on doomed and fated challenges.
A friendly or neutral NPC’s challenges work just like a player’s. However, challenges work slightly differently for hostile or antagonistic NPCs. Whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge would generate a doomed result, then one of the players may invoke a free twist of fate as if they rolled a fated challenge. Conversely, whenever an enemy NPC’s challenge is fated, that generates a doomed effect for the players. The GM will typically choose the player most closely related to the roll to benefit or suffer from NPCs’ fate dice.</p>
