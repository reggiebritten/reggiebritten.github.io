<h3 id="opposed-challenges">Opposed Challenges</h3>

<p>At times, multiple characters strive oppose each other with challenges. In that case each side (considering the rules for group ability rolls if applicable) makes a separate roll. The GM should apply boons and banes for circumstances as usual, but typically only to one side or the other.</p>

<p>The side with the higher ability roll wins and gets the result they wanted. If both sides roll the same number, then nothing changes and things stay as they were before the roll.</p>
