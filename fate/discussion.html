<h3 id="discussions">Discussions</h3>

<p>If you and your allies have differing opinions about a fateful deed, you are encouraged to discuss your options amongst yourselves. If you sincerely advocate for a choice that aligns with your personal <a href="personality.html#values">values</a>, then you are satisfied that you have spoken you piece. Even if your group eventually comes to a decision that opposes your values, you donâ€™t suffer stress or have to change your values. In fact you gain a point of fate just as if you were aligned with the deed! The heroes of Forge of Legends may have colorful personalities, but they always find a way to put aside their differences and work together.</p>
