<h2 id="fateful-deeds">Fateful Deeds</h2>

<p>A fateful deed is an important decision made in the spirit of one of the six personal <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#personal-values">values</a>. The GM will inform you when one of your actions qualifies as a fateful deed, and which value the deed aligns with. You may also nominate the actions of your fellow players if you think that their choices have been significant. A fateful deed could be something you say, do, or even don’t do, but it must always be a significant, informed, and voluntary choice.</p>

<p>When you’ve earned a fateful deed, compare the personal value that the GM assigned the deed to your own value.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you are <strong>aligned</strong> with the deed, you gain a point of fate! Furthermore, you may choose to shift your values one point toward the value of the deed and away from the opposite value, to a maximum of 5 and minimum of 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are <strong>neutral</strong> on the deed’s axis, you may choose to shift your values one point toward the value of the deed, but you do not gain fate or suffer stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are <strong>opposed</strong> to the deed’s value, then you face a dilemma. You must either admit your priorities have changed, and shift your values one point in the direction of the deed, or you suffer two stress for the dissonance between your thoughts and your actions. However you can avoid these consequences if you have a discussion with your allies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="discussions">Discussions</h3>

<p>If you and your allies have differing opinions about a fateful deed, you are encouraged to discuss your options amongst yourselves. If you sincerely advocate for a choice that aligns with your personal <a class = "keyword" href="personality.html#personal-values">values</a>, then you are satisfied that you have spoken you piece. Even if your group eventually comes to a decision that opposes your values, you don’t suffer stress or have to change your values. In fact you gain a point of fate just as if you were aligned with the deed! The heroes of Forge of Legends may have colorful personalities, but they always find a way to put aside their differences and work together.</p>
