<h2 id="twists-of-fate">Twists of Fate</h2>

<p>Once you have earned a fate point, you may spend it to invoke a twist of fate. A twist of fate lets you add a detail to the game world, such as adding a feature to the environment, adding an item to your inventory, or establishing a fact about an NPC.. You can even invoke a twist of fate during a <a href="rolls.html">roll</a>, giving you a bonus. Getting three or more successes on a roll also allows you to invoke a twist of fate without spending a fate point, or refunding a point you spend!</p>

<p>Any detail, no matter the subject and no matter how large or small, can be invoked by a twist of fate. However, players may only add detail, not remove or change details that have already been established. Furthermore, while you can add details to the environment and to NPCs, you canâ€™t add details to your character or other players characters; those must be discovered through <a href="personality.html#flashbacks">flashbacks</a>. The GM always has the authority to veto a twist of fate if they decide it would not fit in with the world.</p>
