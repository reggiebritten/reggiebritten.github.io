<h3 id="defeated">Defeated</h3>

<p>Unless combatants flee or come to terms, combat will end in the defeat of one side or the other. A defeated character has had their <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> and <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> all reduced to zero, and is out of the fight. The remainder of any damage dealt beyond their current defense is dealt directly to your <a href="stress.html">stress</a> instead.</p>

<p>While you’re defeated, you are still conscious and can still talk. But you can’t take any <a href="skills.html#action">actions</a> or <a href="skills.html#reaction">reactions</a>, can’t gain <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> or <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>, you loose your <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, you’re <a href="skills.html#interrupt">interrupted</a> and can’t <a href="skills.html#concentration">concentrate</a> and the only maneuver you can use is to <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> one space. If you continue to take damage, your <a href="stress.html">stress</a> is increased by the damage dealt and they may begin to suffer afflictions.</p>

<p>Your can recuperate from being defeated if you or another character spend 10 minutes tending to your wounds and restoring your strength. Once you are no longer defeated, your poise momentum and focus are restored to their base values and you are ready to fight again. Being defeated doesn’t inherently carry any penalties. However, any stress and afflictions may linger for days, until you have a chance to recover.</p>
