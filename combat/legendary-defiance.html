<h3 id="legendary-defiance">Legendary Defiance</h3>
<p>Legendary creatures are tough to take down for long. When a legendary creature is defeated, it can use a point of legendary defiance to stay in the fight. Using legendary defiance also grants the creature several other benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The creature roars, which automatically <a href="skills.html#interrupt">interrupts</a> all other character’s within earshot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All non-<a href="conditions.html#persistent">persistent</a> <a href="conditions.html">conditions</a> are removed form the creature, as well as the <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, <a href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, and <a href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a> conditions are removed from the creature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creature’s <a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, and <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> are set to their base values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some creatures may gain access to new and more powerful <a href="skills.html">skills</a> after they use a certain amount of legendary defiance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each legendary creature has a certain amount of legendary defiance points to use. After the creature has used all of them, you must defeat it one final time to finish it off once and for all!</p>
