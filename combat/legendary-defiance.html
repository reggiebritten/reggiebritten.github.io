<h3 id="legendary-defiance">Legendary Defiance</h3>
<p>Legendary creatures are tough to take down for long. When a legendary creature is defeated, it can use a point of legendary defiance to stay in the fight. Using legendary defiance also grants the creature several other benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The creature roars, which automatically <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#interrupting-concentration">interrupts</a> all other character’s within earshot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All non-<a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#persistent">persistent</a> <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">conditions</a> are removed form the creature, as well as the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, and <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a> conditions are removed from the creature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creature’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, and <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> are set to their base values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some creatures may raise the stakes of the battle in exciting ways after they use a certain amount of legendary defiance!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, you should still savor your victory! When you force a creature to use a point of legendary defiance, you may invoke a <a class = "keyword" href="fate.html#twists-of-fate">twist of fate</a> related to the event for free. For example, you may declare that your attack shredded the dragon’s wing to taters, preventing if from flying and imposing a name on it’s wing attacks.</p>

<p>Each legendary creature has a certain amount of legendary defiance points to use. After the creature has used all of them, you must defeat it one final time to finish it off once and for all!</p>
