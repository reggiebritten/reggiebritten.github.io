<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>

<p>Focus represents your awareness of yourself, other character in the battle, and the battlefield itself. Your base focus is equal to five plus five times your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>. When your focus is reduced to zero, you become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a>, making you just as likely to target allies as enemies.</p>

<p>Skills that require intense attention will cost focus, but skills that gain focus only take a fleeting thought. Anything that draws a character’s attention away from the battle will deplete their focus, including an enemy’s projectile or a booming explosion.</p>
