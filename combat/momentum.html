<h3 id="momentum">Momentum</h3>

<p>Momentum describes how much physical force you can put into their movements. Your base momentum is equal to five plus five times your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a>. When your momentum is reduced to zero, you become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, which prevents you from moving.</p>

<p>A skill that slams down into the ground might cost momentum, while a skill that lets you surge forward might grant momentum. Effects that slam, push, or buffet you, like a mace strike or howling winds, might damage or reduce your momentum.</p>
