<h3 id="high-ground">High Ground</h3>

<p>A space that is about 3 feet or 1 meter higher than another space counts as higher ground. Moving up to higher ground costs an additional movement point, but you may move two spaces downward for each point of movement. A gradual slope may require moving laterally several spaces to ascend or descend one space.</p>

<p>Your <a href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> <a href="skills.html#attack">attacks</a> gain a <a href="skills.html#boon">boon</a> against targets on lower ground, but your melee attacks suffer a <a href="skills.html#bane">bane</a> against targets on higher ground. When you use a ranged skill from higher or lower ground, add or subtract the height difference to the <a href="skills.html#ranged">range</a> of the skill, respectively.</p>
