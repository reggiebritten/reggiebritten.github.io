<h3 id="high-ground">High Ground</h3>

<p>An area that is about 3 feet or 1 meter higher than another counts as higher ground. Moving up to higher ground costs an additional movement point, but you may move two paces downward for each point of movement. A gradual slope may require moving laterally several paces to ascend or descend one pace.</p>

<p>Your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a> gain a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> against targets on lower ground, but your melee attacks suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> against targets on higher ground. When you use a ranged skill from higher or lower ground, add or subtract the height difference to the <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ranged">range</a> of the skill, respectively.</p>
