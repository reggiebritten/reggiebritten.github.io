<h3 id="surrounded">Surrounded</h3>

<p>You might become surrounded if you have multiple enemies or obstacles closing off your retreat. <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">Attacks</a> gain a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> against you while you are surrounded.</p>

<p>In simple terms, you are surrounded if you can’t leave an enemy’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>. More precisely, you are surrounded if you are within the zone of control of one or more enemies, and every adjacent space into which you could move is also within the zone of control of at least one of those enemies. You are also surrounded if you have two enemies with active zones of control on directly opposite corners of you.</p>

<p>Even if you can’t move, or could teleport, the adjacent spaces into which you could hypothetically move should be considered. If an obstacle prevents movement into a space, that space doesn’t need to be in an enemy’s zone of control for you to be surrounded. You are not surrounded as long as you could leave the zones of control you are currently in, even if it means moving into someone else’s zone of control. Since you can move into the space of a friendly character, a space occupied by a friendly character doesn’t count against you to determine if you are surrounded, unless it is also in an enemy’s zone of control.</p>
