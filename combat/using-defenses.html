<p>Under normal circumstances, a character begins combat at their base poise, base momentum, and base focus. A character’s base poise is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/agility.md">agility</a>, their base momentum is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/brawn.md">brawn</a>, and their base focus is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/cunning.md">cunning</a>.
Many skills allow characters to gain defense, and a character may gain defense above their base value. However, practically all of these are noisy, obvious, and threatening to any enemies nearby. Even in the absence of apparent enemies, the GM may add <a href="playing/doom.md">doom</a> to the pool if players dally to gain defense in dangerous territory. When the adrenaline of combat fades, typically after about a minute, the characters’ poise momentum and focus return to their base values.
When a character’s poise, momentum, or focus are reduced to zero, typically by enemy attacks, they begin to suffer major setbacks. When a character’s poise is reduced to zero, they become <a href="combat/reeling.md">reeling</a>. A character who’s momentum is reduced to zero becomes <a href="combat/knocked-down.md">knocked-down</a>. And if a character’s focus is reduced to zero, they become <a href="combat/confused.md">confused</a>. Reeling, knocked-down, and confused are explained in the <a href="combat/damage-defeat.md">Damage &amp; Defeat</a> section below.</p>
