<h2 id="underwater-combat">Underwater Combat</h2>

<p>Fighting while swimming can be extremely difficult if you are unprepared. Spaces of water count as <a class = "keyword" href="special-terrain.html#wet-terrain">wet-terrain</a>, and require an extra point of movement for every space moved. You automatically become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#wet">wet</a> while swimming, and the wet condition is instantly reapplied if it is ever removed. Your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skills</a> suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> while you are swimming, but the GM may determine that certain skills from <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#dagger">daggers</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#one-handed">one-handed</a> <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#polearm">polearms</a>, and similar weapons remain effective. Almost all <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ranged">ranged</a> skills, including <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#utility">utility</a> and <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#support">support</a> skills, are <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ineffective">ineffective</a> against a target more than 5 spaces away in water. The GM may further rule that some skills are impossible or have other penalties underwater.</p>

<p>If you are unexpectedly plunged under water, you suffer the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#choking">choking</a> condition, and that condition is <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#persistent">persistent</a> while you remain under water. However, if you intentionally hold your breath on your turn, you are immune to the choking condition, but you lose -2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> and -2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> at the end of your turn. See the <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#breath-holding">breath holding</a> rules for dives lasting longer than a few rounds.</p>
