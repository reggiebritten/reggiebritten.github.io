<h3 id="cover">Cover</h3>

<p>Any <a href="skills.html">skill</a> that passes through a space containing an obstacle or another character suffers a <a href="skills.html#bane">bane</a>. Attack, utility, ranged, and melee skills can all be penalized by cover. The obstacle might be a tree, a corner, a low wall, or anything else that would partially block your view of the target. Remember than you can’t normally target a character that you can’t see at all.</p>

<p>You can’t normally pop out from behind cover, attack, then duck back into cover all on your turn. However, some objects, like a low wall or an arrow slit, might provide cover for you but not interfere with your skills.</p>
