<h2 id="zone-of-control">Zone of Control</h2>

<p>Your zone of control, sometimes abbreviated as “ZoC”, is the area of the battlefield where you can interfere with an enemy. Any <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ranged">ranged</a> skill used while in an enemy’s zone of control suffers a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a>. Your zone of control also determines where you can <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#hindering-maneuvers">hinder</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> and when you have an enemy <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#surrounded">surrounded</a>.</p>

<p>A character armed with a <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#weapon">weapon</a> with the <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#zoC">ZoC</a> tag, typically a weapon used for melee combat, has a zone of control that includes their own space and all spaces adjacent to them. You don’t have a zone of control if you don’t have a ZOC weapon, although some creatures might. You might temporarily loose your zone of control while you are <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, confused, or affected by certain other <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">conditions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hindering-maneuvers">Hindering Maneuvers</h3>

<p>Using most <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> while engaged with the enemy is risky. Whenever you use a maneuver in an enemy character’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone-of-control</a>, that enemy can hinder you. When you are hindered, you immediately lose -3 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, -3 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, and -3 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>. Hindering is not an attack; there is no threat or yield, your <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#armor">armor</a> doesn’t reduce the loss, and excess doesn’t carry over to another defense.</p>

<p>You may enter a hostile character’s zone of control without being hindered, but using a maneuver to move from within an enemy zone of control allows that enemy to hinder you. A skill with the <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#careful">careful</a> tag can’t be hindered. <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#actions">Actions</a> and <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a> also can’t be hindered, even if they let you move. However far you move, each enemy can only hinder you once per maneuver.</p>

<h3 id="surrounded">Surrounded</h3>

<p>You might become surrounded if you have multiple enemies or obstacles closing off your retreat. <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">Attacks</a> gain a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> against you while you are surrounded.</p>

<p>In simple terms, you are surrounded if you can’t leave an enemy’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>. More precisely, you are surrounded if you are within the zone of control of one or more enemies, and every adjacent space into which you could move is also within the zone of control of at least one of those enemies. You are also surrounded if you have two enemies with active zones of control on directly opposite corners of you.</p>

<p>Even if you can’t move, or could teleport, the adjacent spaces into which you could hypothetically move should be considered. If an obstacle prevents movement into a space, that space doesn’t need to be in an enemy’s zone of control for you to be surrounded. You are not surrounded as long as you could leave the zones of control you are currently in, even if it means moving into someone else’s zone of control. Since you can move into the space of a friendly character, a space occupied by a friendly character doesn’t count against you to determine if you are surrounded, unless it is also in an enemy’s zone of control.</p>
