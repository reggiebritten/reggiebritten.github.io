<p>Your armor reduces the threat and the yield damage of enemy attacks. Your brawn determines what kind of armor you can equip; see the equipment section for more details on equipping armor. If one skill would deal damage to more than one of your defenses, you may choose which one of your defenses your armor protects.</p>
