<h2 id="defenses">Defenses</h2>

<p>Emerge victorious, you will likely need to <a href="combat.html#damage--defeat">defeat</a> your enemies. That is achieved by reducing all their defenses to zero. Player characters and elite or legendary enemies have three defenses: poise, momentum, and focus.</p>

<p>The GM won’t normally ask you to keep track of your defenses outside of combat. Under normal circumstances, you begin combat at your base poise, base momentum, and base focus.</p>

<p>You can gain defense above these values, but doing so is likely to attract unwanted attention if you haven’t already. The GM will gain a point of <a href="wip.html#game-running/doom">doom</a> if you dally to gain defense in dangerous territory. When the adrenaline of combat fades, typically after about a minute, your poise momentum and focus return to their base values.</p>

<h3 id="poise">Poise</h3>

<p>Poise describes your precise balance and control of your weapons and fighting stance. Your base poise is equal to five plus five times your <a href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a>. When your poise is reduced to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, which weakens all your <a href="skills.html#attack">attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Skills that spend poise require precise coordination, while skills that gain poise let you regain your balance. Taking poise damage means being knocked off balance or being forced into an awkward position, and fighting atop a swaying bridge might cause a character to lose poise.</p>

<h3 id="momentum">Momentum</h3>

<p>Momentum describes how much physical force you can put into their movements. Your base momentum is equal to five plus five times your <a href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a>. When your momentum is reduced to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, which prevents you from moving.</p>

<p>A skill that slams down into the ground might cost momentum, while a skill that lets you surge forward might grant momentum. Effects that slam, push, or buffet you, like a mace strike or howling winds, might damage or reduce your momentum.</p>

<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>

<p>Focus represents your awareness of yourself, other character in the battle, and the battlefield itself. Your base focus is equal to five plus five times your <a href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>. When your focus is reduced to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a>, making you just as likely to target allies as enemies.</p>

<p>Skills that require intense attention will cost focus, but skills that gain focus only take a fleeting thought. Anything that draws a character’s attention away from the battle will deplete their focus, including an enemy’s projectile or a booming explosion.</p>

<h3 id="minions-defenses">Minions’ Defenses</h3>

<p>Many weaker NPCs, called minions, do not have poise, momentum, or focus. Instead, they simply have defense, which represents all three together. Whenever a minion would gain or lose poise, momentum or focus, their defense is adjusted by that amount instead.</p>
