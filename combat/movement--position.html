<h2 id="movement--position">Movement &amp; Position</h2>

<p>Movement is counted in spaces, where one space is equivalent to about 5 feet or 1½ meters. The most reliable way to get from place to place is the <a class="item" data-name="Dash">Dash</a> maneuver, which allows you to move 3 spaces plus your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#speed">speed</a>. However, using most <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> in an enemy’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a> carries a risk of being <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#hindering-maneuvers">hindered</a>, as described below. Another movement option is the <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> maneuver, which lets you move exactly 1 space. Since <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> has the <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#careful">careful</a> tag, it can ’t be hindered. Finally, the <a class="item" data-name="Sprint">Sprint</a> reaction lets a character trade <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> for a burst of speed.</p>

<p>There are a few rules that must be followed when you move. You can move freely through another friendly character’s space, but not an enemy’s. You can’t end their your in another character’s space; if you somehow find yourself sharing a space with another character, the GM will move one of you to an adjacent space.</p>

<p>Moving diagonally costs one space of movement the first time you move diagonally on a turn, then two spaces for the next time you move diagonally, repeating that pattern as they continue to move diagonally. You can’t move diagonally if the movement would cut through an impassable obstacle or a enemy’s space.</p>

<p>Some effects may require you to use additional movement to enter a space. If you can’t afford this extra movement, you can’t enter that space. Other effects prevent movement entirely, including any movement specified by a skill.</p>

<h3 id="shoving">Shoving</h3>

<p>Some skills will shove you in a specific direction. If you are shoved toward or away from something, each each space you are shoved into must be closer or further than the previous space, respectively.</p>

<p>Being shoved ignores movement restrictions from <a class = "keyword" href="special-terrain.html">special terrain</a>. You can’t be shoved into a space occupied by another character or an obstacle. Instead, when you are shoved into an occupied space, you lose 2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> per remaining space you would have been pushed. You begin <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#falling">falling</a> when you are shoved off a ledge, and any remaining distance you would be shoved is ignored.</p>

<p>The distance you are shoved is increased by one for each <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#size">size</a> larger than you the character shoving you is. Likewise, the distance you are shoved is reduced for each size smaller than you they are, to a minimum of zero spaces.</p>

<h3 id="high-ground">High Ground</h3>

<p>A space that is about 3 feet or 1 meter higher than another space counts as higher ground. Moving up to higher ground costs an additional movement point, but you may move two spaces downward for each point of movement. A gradual slope may require moving laterally several spaces to ascend or descend one space.</p>

<p>Your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a> gain a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#boons">boon</a> against targets on lower ground, but your melee attacks suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> against targets on higher ground. When you use a ranged skill from higher or lower ground, add or subtract the height difference to the <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#ranged">range</a> of the skill, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="cover">Cover</h3>

<p>Any <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skill</a> that passes through a space containing an obstacle or another character suffers a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a>. Attack, utility, ranged, and melee skills can all be penalized by cover. The obstacle might be a tree, a corner, a low wall, or anything else that would partially block your view of the target. Remember than you can’t normally target a character that you can’t see at all.</p>

<p>You can’t normally pop out from behind cover, attack, then duck back into cover all on your turn. However, some objects, like a low wall or an arrow slit, might provide cover for you but not interfere with your skills.</p>

<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<p>Your size describes how big you are and how much space you take up. A normal human’s size is 1. A character with a size larger than one takes up a square with each side made of spaces equal to their size, so a size 3 character takes up a three by three square, or nine spaces in total.</p>

<p>Smaller character are described with lower numbers, such as 0, -1, -2, and so on. Such creatures normally still take up one entire space, but the GM may allow characters of significantly different sizes to share a space. Different sizes don’t come with any inherent bonuses or penalties, but may become relevant for certain <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skills</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">conditions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="disarmed">Disarmed</h3>

<p>When you become disarmed, everything you are holding is thrown three spaces away in random directions, including wielded <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#weapon">weapons</a>. You will need to draw new weapons or reverie your old ones to stay in fighting shape.</p>
