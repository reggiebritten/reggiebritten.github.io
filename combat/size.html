<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<p>Your size describes how big you are and how much space you take up. A normal human’s size is 1. A character with a size larger than one takes up a square with each side made of spaces equal to their size, so a size 3 character takes up a three by three square, or nine spaces in total.</p>

<p>Smaller character are described with lower numbers, such as 0, -1, -2, and so on. Such creatures normally still take up one entire space, but the GM may allow characters of significantly different sizes to share a space. Different sizes don’t come with any inherent bonuses or penalties, but may become relevant for certain <a href="...html#skills">skills</a> or <a href="...html#conditions">conditions</a>.</p>
