<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<p>Your size describes how big you are and how much space you take up. A normal human’s size is 1. A character with a size larger than one takes up a square with each side made of paces equal to their size, so a size 3 character takes up a three pace by three pace square.</p>

<p>Smaller character are described with lower numbers, such as 0, -1, -2, and so on. The GM may allow characters of significantly different sizes to share an area. Different sizes don’t come with any inherent bonuses or penalties, but may become relevant for certain <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skills</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">conditions</a>.</p>
