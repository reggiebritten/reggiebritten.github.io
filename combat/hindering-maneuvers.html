<h3 id="hindering-maneuvers">Hindering Maneuvers</h3>

<p>Using most <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuvers</a> while engaged with the enemy is risky. Whenever you use a maneuver in an enemy character’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone-of-control</a>, that enemy can hinder you. When you are hindered, you immediately lose -2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, -2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, and -2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>. Hindering is not an attack; there is no threat or yield and your <a class = "keyword" href="equipment.html#armor">armor</a> doesn’t reduce the loss.</p>

<p>You may enter a hostile character’s zone of control without being hindered, but using a maneuver to move from within an enemy zone of control allows that enemy to hinder you. A skill with the <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#careful">careful</a> tag can’t be hindered. <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#actions">Actions</a> and <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a> also can’t be hindered, even if they let you move. However far you move, each enemy can only hinder you once per maneuver.</p>
