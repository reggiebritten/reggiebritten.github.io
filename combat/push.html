  <h3 id="optional-rule-pushing-and-size-difference">Optional Rule: Pushing and size difference</h3>

  <p>If your group uses this rule, it can be easy for larger characters to push around smaller ones, and harder for small character to push bigger ones. Whenever one character pushes another, the distance pushed is increased by 1 for every size larger the pushing character is, but decreased by 1 for every size smaller the pushing character is.</p>
