<h2 id="defenses">Defenses</h2>

<p>The most common goal of combat is to <a href="combat/damage-defeat.md">defeat</a> your enemies, and that is achieved by reducing all their defenses to zero. Player characters and elite or legendary enemies have three defenses: poise, momentum, and focus.</p>
<h4 id="poise">Poise</h4>

<p>Poise describes a character’s precise balance and control of their weapons and fighting stance. Skills that spend poise require precise coordination, while skills that gain poise let the character regain their balance. Taking poise damage means being knocked off balance or being forced into an awkward position, and fighting atop a swaying bridge might cause a character to lose poise.
A character’s base poise is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/agility.md">agility</a>. When a character’s poise is reduced to zero, they become <a href="combat/reeling.md">reeling</a>, weakening all their <a href="skills/attack.md">attacks</a>.</p>

<h4 id="momentum">Momentum</h4>

<p>Momentum describes how much physical force a character can put into their movements. A skill that slams down into the ground might cost momentum, while a skill that lets a character surge forward might grant momentum. Effects that slam, push, or buffet a character, like a mace strike or howling winds, might damage or reduce a character’s momentum.
A character’s base momentum is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/brawn.md">brawn</a>. When a character’s momentum is reduced to zero, they become <a href="combat/knocked-down.md">knocked-down</a>, preventing them from moving.</p>

<h4 id="focus">Focus</h4>

<p>Focus represents a character’s awareness of themselves, other character in the battle, and the battlefield itself. <a href="skill.md">Skills</a> that require intense attention will cost focus, but skills that gain focus only take a fleeting thought. Anything that draws a character’s attention away from the battle will deplete their focus, including an enemy’s projectile or a booming explosion.
A character’s base focus is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/cunning.md">cunning</a>. When a character’s focus is reduces to zero, they become <a href="combat/confused.md">confused</a>, making them just as likely to target allies as enemies.</p>

<h3 id="minions-defenses">Minions’ Defenses</h3>

<p>Many weaker NPCs, called minions, do not have poise, momentum, or focus. Instead, they simply have defense, which represents all three together. Whenever a minion would gain or lose poise, momentum or focus, their defense is adjusted by that amount instead.</p>

<h3 id="using-defenses">Using Defenses</h3>

<p>Under normal circumstances, a character begins combat at their base poise, base momentum, and base focus. A character’s base poise is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/agility.md">agility</a>, their base momentum is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/brawn.md">brawn</a>, and their base focus is equal to five plus five times their <a href="abilities/cunning.md">cunning</a>.
Many skills allow characters to gain defense, and a character may gain defense above their base value. However, practically all of these are noisy, obvious, and threatening to any enemies nearby. Even in the absence of apparent enemies, the GM may add <a href="playing/doom.md">doom</a> to the pool if players dally to gain defense in dangerous territory. When the adrenaline of combat fades, typically after about a minute, the characters’ poise momentum and focus return to their base values.
When a character’s poise, momentum, or focus are reduced to zero, typically by enemy attacks, they begin to suffer major setbacks. When a character’s poise is reduced to zero, they become <a href="combat/reeling.md">reeling</a>. A character who’s momentum is reduced to zero becomes <a href="combat/knocked-down.md">knocked-down</a>. And if a character’s focus is reduced to zero, they become <a href="combat/confused.md">confused</a>. Reeling, knocked-down, and confused are explained in the <a href="combat/damage-defeat.md">Damage &amp; Defeat</a> section below.</p>
