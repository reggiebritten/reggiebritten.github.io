<h3 id="legendary-turns">Legendary Turns</h3>

<p>Legendary creatures, like fearsome dragons, can often take multiple turns during each round of combat. During each of their turns, they get one <a href="skills.html#action">action</a> and one <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a> as normal. Most legendary creatures are limited in how often they can use the same skill each round, but that varies by creature. If you apply a temporary condition to a legendary creature, then it lasts until both the creature and one of your allies both use actions.</p>
