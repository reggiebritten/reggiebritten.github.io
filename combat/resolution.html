<h2 id="order-of-resolution-wip">Order of Resolution [WIP]</h2>

<p>Some skills, attack, support or otherwise, will offer the user, the target, or both a choice about what happens. Unless specified otherwise, a skill’s effects require the character using it to choose first before anything else happens and before the target decides to yield or defend an attack.</p>

<p>However, an attack’s yield requires the target to choose first, then the attacker may choose any additional effects afterwards.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, the skill user chooses the target(s) of the skill and decides on any choices offered by the effects.</li>
  <li>Second, any characters may choose to intervene with reactions, where the first character to declare their reaction may use it first.</li>
  <li>Third, the target chooses from the choices offered, including defening or yielding an attack.</li>
  <li>Fourth, reactions may be used again.</li>
  <li>Fifth, the user chooses from the options offered by the the yield.</li>
  <li>Finally, the user applies any fated effects they may have earned.</li>
</ul>
