<h2 id="turns--rounds">Turns &amp; Rounds</h2>

<p>Combat begins as soon as one character does something that other characters witness and are willing and able to oppose. That first acting character takes the first turn of combat. Any other characters may use a <a href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a> to immediately draw an <a href="equipment.html#weapon">weapons</a> they have equipped as the fray begins. If multiple characters attempt to act at exactly the same time, the GM will call for an <a href="rolls.html#opposed-rolls">opposed</a> <a href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a> roll to see who acts first.</p>

<p>You may use two <a href="skills.html">skills</a> on you turn, one <a href="skills.html#actions">actions</a> and one <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a>. Actions typically involve <a href="skills.html#attacks">attacking</a> enemies or supporting allies, while maneuvers typically involve moving to a better location or preparing for another skill. You may also use <a href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a> on your turn if their triggers as met. You must always finish one skill before starting another; you can’t move a few spaces with a maneuver, use an action, then finish the rest of the maneuver’s movement.</p>

<p>Once your have finished your turn, the GM will determine which of the characters who hasn’t acted yet this turn was most affected by your last turn. This could be the character you targeted with your action, the character to whom you dealt the most damage, or the character you ended your turn closest to, in that order. This could be one of your allies, but the GM will give preference to your enemies if everything else is equal. The <a href="wip.html#game-running/turn-order">turn order</a> section has more guidelines for the GM to determine who goes next.</p>

<p>This cycle continues until all characters have taken their turns, then the round ends. Legendary foes might be able to take multiple rounds in a single turn Some effects, especially environmental effects, do something at the end of the round. Once the round ends, all characters can take turns again, and the GM will start with the character most affected by the last turn of the previous round.</p>

<h3 id="legendary-turns">Legendary Turns</h3>

<p>Legendary creatures, like fearsome dragons, can often take multiple turns during each round of combat. During each of their turns, they get one <a href="skills.html#actions">action</a> and one <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a> as normal. Most legendary creatures are limited in how often they can use the same skill each round, but that varies by creature. If you apply a temporary condition to a legendary creature, then it lasts until both the creature and one of your allies both use actions.</p>
