<h3 id="poise">Poise</h3>

<p>Poise describes your precise balance and control of your weapons and fighting stance. Your base poise is equal to five plus five times your <a href="abilities.html#agility">agility</a>. When your poise is reduced to zero, you become <a href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, which weakens all your <a href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Skills that spend poise require precise coordination, while skills that gain poise let you regain your balance. Taking poise damage means being knocked off balance or being forced into an awkward position, and fighting atop a swaying bridge might cause a character to lose poise.</p>
