<h3 id="yield">Yield</h3>

<p>An <a href="skills.html#attack">attack’s</a> yield describes what the attack does if it is not <a href="combat.html#defending-vs-yielding">defended</a> against. Each attack has a damage type (<a href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, or <a href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>) and damage dice that you roll if the target yields. Add together all the dice to determine the amount of damage you do with the attack. If it is a  <a href="skills.html#melee">melee</a> attack, also add your  <a href="abilities.html#brawn">brawn</a> to this damage. The target’s armor reduces the damage they take from an attack’s yield.</p>

<p>Furthermore, compare each individual die to your <a href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning</a>. Each die that rolls equal to or below your cunning earns you a <a href="skills.html#cunning-effect">cunning effect</a>, in addition to the yield’s other effects!</p>
