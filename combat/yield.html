<h3 id="yield">Yield</h3>

<p>An <a href="...html#skills\attack">attack’s</a> yield describes what the attack does if it is not <a href="defending-vs-yielding.md">defended</a> against. Each attack has a damage type (<a href="poise.md">poise</a>, <a href="momentum.md">momentum</a>, or <a href="focus.md">focus</a>) and damage dice that you roll if the target yields. Add together all the dice to determine the amount of damage you do with the attack. If it is a  <a href="...html#skills\melee">melee</a> attack, also add your  <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">brawn</a> to this damage. The target’s armor reduces the damage they take from an attack’s yield.</p>
