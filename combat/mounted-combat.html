<h2 id="mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</h2>

<p>Fighting from atop a horse or even a mythical flying beast can convey a huge advantage. In order to serve as a mount, a creature needs to be at least one <a href="combat.html#size">size</a> category larger than you. The creature must be willing, and many creatures require a saddle, harness, or other equipment to be ridden properly.</p>

<p>Whenever the mount moves, you move with it. While mounted, you and your mount share all the mount’s spaces. That means you can use <a href="skills.html">skills</a> as if you where in any of the mount’s spaces, but skills can also target you if they target any of the mount’s spaces. If you have a normal <a href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, then all spaces adjacent to the mount are within your zone of control. If an enemy <a href="combat.html#hindering-maneuvers">hinders</a> the mount’s movement, they may hinder either you or the mount.</p>

<p>While mounted, you use the mount’s <a href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> as if it were your own. Skills and effects that cause you to gain or lose momentum or take momentum damage cause the mount to gain or lose momentum or take damage instead. If either you or the mount are <a href="combat.html#shoving">shoved</a>, <a href="conditions.html#kneeling">kneeling</a>, or <a href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, you fall from the mount and your momentum is reduced to 4 if it was higher. If you dismount intentionally, your momentum returns to what it was before you mounted the creature. Depending on your mount’s size, and the battlefield around you, your mount might give you the benefits of <a href="combat.html#high-ground">high ground</a>, as determined by the GM.</p>

<p>If the mount has only animal intelligence, like a horse, then you must use your turn to command it. Instead of your <a href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a>, the mount may use a maneuver, and instead of your <a href="skills.html#action">action</a>, the mount may use an action. It doesn’t use actions or maneuvers unless you use yours to command it. If the mount has any <a href="skills.html#reaction">reactions</a>, you may choose to use them whenever their triggers are met. Such mounts are not perfect, and may disobey you if they are put in unfamiliar situations.</p>

<p>If the mount is reasonably intelligent, then it acts on its own, taking its own turn during combat and using its own actions and maneuvers. You may use your actions and maneuvers independently while mounted, although you still share the mount’s momentum.</p>
