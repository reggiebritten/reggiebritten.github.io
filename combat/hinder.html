<p>Using most <a href="...html#skills\maneuvers">maneuvers</a> while engaged with the enemy is risky. Whenever you use a maneuver in an enemy character’s <a href="zone-of-control.md">zone-of-control</a>, that enemy can hinder you. When you are hindered, you immediately lose -2 <a href="poise.md">poise</a>, -2 <a href="momentum.md">momentum</a>, and -2 <a href="focus.md">focus</a>. Hindering is not an attack; there is no threat or yield and your <a href="...html#equipment\armor">armor</a> doesn’t reduce the loss.
You may enter a hostile character’s zone of control without being hindered, but using a maneuver to move from within an enemy zone of control allows that enemy to hinder you. A skill with the <a href="...html#skills\careful">careful</a> tag can’t be hindered. <a href="...html#skills\action">Actions</a> and <a href="...html#skills\reaction">reactions</a> also can’t be hindered, even if they let you move. However far you move, each enemy can only hinder you once per maneuver.</p>
