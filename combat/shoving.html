<p>Some skills will shove you in a specific direction. If you are shoved toward or away from something, each each space you are shoved into must be closer or further than the previous space, respectively.</p>

<p>Being shoved ignores movement restrictions from <a href="...html#special-terrain">special terrain</a>. You canâ€™t be shoved into a space occupied by another character or an obstacle.
