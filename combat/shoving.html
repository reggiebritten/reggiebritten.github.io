<p>Some skills will shove you in a specific direction. If you are shoved toward or away from something, you must end up closer or further than your previous position, respectively.</p>

<p>Being shoved ignores movement restrictions from <a class = "keyword" href="special-terrain.html">special terrain</a>. You canâ€™t be shoved into an area occupied by another character or an obstacle. Instead, when you are shoved into an occupied area, you lose 2 <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> per remaining pace you would have been pushed. You begin <a class = "keyword" href="exploration.html#falling">falling</a> when you are shoved off a ledge, and any remaining distance you would be shoved is ignored.</p>

<p>The distance you are shoved is increased by one for each <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#size">size</a> larger than you the character shoving you is. Likewise, the distance you are shoved is reduced for each size smaller than you they are, to a minimum of zero paces.</p>
