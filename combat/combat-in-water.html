<h2 id="combat-in-water">Combat in Water</h2>

<p>Fighting while swimming can be extremely difficult if you are unprepared. Spaces of water count as <a href="...html#special-terrain\wet-terrain">wet-terrain</a>, and require an extra point of movement for every space moved. You automatically become <a href="...html#conditions\wet">wet</a> while swimming, and the wet condition is instantly reapplied if it is ever removed. All your <a href="...html#skills">skills</a> suffer a <a href="...html#skills\bane">bane</a> while you are swimming, unless they are made with a <a class="item" data-name="Dagger">Dagger</a>, <a class="item" data-name="Short Spear">Short Spear</a>, or similar weapon. The GM may further rule that some skills are impossible or have other penalties underwater.</p>

<p>If you are unexpectedly plunged under water, you suffer the <a href="...html#conditions\choking">choking</a> condition, and that condition is <a href="...html#conditions\persistent">persistent</a> while you remain under water. However, if you intentionally hold your breath on your turn, you are immune to the choking condition, but you lose -2 <a href="momentum.md">momentum</a> and -2 <em>focus</em> at the end of your turn. See the <a href="...html#exploration\breath-holding">breath holding</a> rules for dives lasting longer than a few rounds.</p>
