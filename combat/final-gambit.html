<h3 id="final-gambit">Final Gambit</h3>

<p>The most deadly warrior is a desperate one. You may invoke a final gambit on your turn, letting you push through any hardship for one last chance at victory. During the round of your final gambit, you gain several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can spend as much <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defenses">defense</a> as you want on any <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skill</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You ignore any banes on your skills and <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">rolls</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You gain a boon on your skills and rolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#speed">speed</a> increases by five.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, pushing your limits comes at a cost. After the round of your final gambit, your remaining defenses are all depleted, you are immediately <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defeated">defeated</a>, and you suffer one <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>. NPCs, including minions and legendary creatures, are also capable of final gambits, so never underestimate a foe.</p>
