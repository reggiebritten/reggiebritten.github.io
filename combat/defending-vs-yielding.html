<h2 id="defending-vs-yielding">Defending vs Yielding</h2>

<p>When you are attacked, you must choose to either defend against or yield to the attack. Defending against an attack means taking damage equal to the attack’s threat to your choice of <a href="poise.md">poise</a>, <a href="momentum.md">momentum</a>, or <a href="focus.md">focus</a>. Your armor reduces the attack’s threat against you. If you successfully defend against an attack, then the attack’s yield never comes to pass; no dice are rolled and no other yield effects are applied.</p>

<p>Defending with poise is called dodging, defending with momentum is called blocking, and defending with focus is called predicting. Some attacks may be <a href="...html#skills\undodgeable">undodgeable</a>, <a href="...html#skills\unblockable">unblockable</a>, or <a href="...html#skills\unpredictable">unpredictable</a>, preventing you from defending in those ways.</p>

<p>You can only defend against an attack with a specific defense if that defense is at least equal to the threat of the attack targeting you. For example, you cannot block  an attack with 11 threat (after subtracting your armor) if your remaining momentum is only 10. If you can’t block, dodge or predict an attack, then you have no choice but to <a href="yield.md">yield</a> to it.</p>

<h3 id="yield">Yield</h3>

<p>An <a href="...html#skills\attack">attack’s</a> yield describes what the attack does if it is not <a href="defending-vs-yielding.md">defended</a> against. Each attack has a damage type (<a href="poise.md">poise</a>, <a href="momentum.md">momentum</a>, or <a href="focus.md">focus</a>) and damage dice that you roll if the target yields. Add together all the dice to determine the amount of damage you do with the attack. If it is a  <a href="...html#skills\melee">melee</a> attack, also add your  <a href="...html#abilities\brawn">brawn</a> to this damage. The target’s armor reduces the damage they take from an attack’s yield.</p>
