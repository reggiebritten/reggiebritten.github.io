<h3 id="defeated">Defeated</h3>

However, any stress and afflictions may linger for days, until you have a chance to recover.</p>

<h3 id="final-gambit">Final Gambit</h3>

<p>The most deadly warrior is a desperate one. You may invoke a final gambit on your turn, letting you push through any hardship for one last chance at victory. During the round of your final gambit, you gain several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can spend as much <a href="defenses.md">defense</a> as you want on any <a href="...html#skills">skill</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You ignore any banes on your skills and <a href="...html#rolls">rolls</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You gain a boon on your skills and rolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <a href="...html#abilities\speed">speed</a> increases by five.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, pushing your limits comes at a cost. After the round of your final gambit, your defenses are all depleted, you are immediately <a href="defeated.md">defeated</a>, and you suffer one <a href="...html#stress">stress</a>. NPCs and even minions are capable of a final gambit, so never underestimate a foe.</p>
