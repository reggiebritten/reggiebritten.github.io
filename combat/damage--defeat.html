<h2 id="damage--defeat">Damage &amp; Defeat</h2>

<p>Damage will reduce your defenses and interfere with your ability to continue the fight. Most damage is dealt by <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attack</a>, but objects and the environment can also deal damage. If damage reduces your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> falls to zero, you become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, when your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> is reduced to zero, you become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, and when your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> is depleted, you become <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a>. If all three pools are depleted, then you are defeated and excess damage carries over to your <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>.</p>

<p>When you defeat an enemy with a skill, take a close look at each of the dice you rolled to do so. Each dice that you didn’t use to defeat them - whether for their damage or for their <a class = "keyword" href="abilities.html#cunning">cunning effect</a> - earn you a free <a class = "keyword" href="fate.html#twists-of-fate">twist of fate</a>! This twist of fate must be related to the way you defeated your enemy, and you can earn multiple twists of fate if you have plenty of dice to spare!</p>

<h3 id="reeling">Reeling</h3>

<p><strong><a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#persistent">Persistent</a></strong></p>

<p>A reeling character’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> has been reduce to zero, leaving them in a unable to coordinate an attack. While reeling, you can’t gain poise, you loose your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and you suffer a <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#banes">bane</a> on all your <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#attacks">attacks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="knocked-down">Knocked-Down</h3>

<p><strong><a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#persistent">Persistent</a></strong></p>

<p>A knocked-down character’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> has been reduce to zero, leaving them immobile on the ground. While knocked-down, you can’t gain momentum, you loose your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and you can’t move except with the <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> skill.</p>

<h3 id="confused">Confused</h3>

<p><strong><a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#persistent">Persistent</a></strong></p>

<p>A confused character’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> has been reduced to zero, and they have lost track of the battle around them. While confused, you can’t gain focus, you loose your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, and all your skills target a random character within the skill’s range.</p>

<h3 id="defeated">Defeated</h3>

<p>Unless combatants flee or come to terms, combat will end in the defeat of one side or the other. A defeated character has had their <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> and <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a> all reduced to zero, and is out of the fight. The remainder of any damage dealt beyond their current defense is dealt directly to your <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a> instead.</p>

<p>While you’re defeated, you are still conscious and can still talk. But you can’t take any <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#actions">actions</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#reactions">reactions</a>, can’t gain <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a> or <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a>, you loose your <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#zone-of-control">zone of control</a>, you’re <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#interrupting-concentration">interrupted</a> and can’t <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#concentration">concentrate</a> and the only maneuver you can use is to <a class="item" data-name="Shift">Shift</a> one space. If you continue to take damage, your <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a> is increased by the damage dealt and they may begin to suffer afflictions.</p>

<p>Your can recuperate from being defeated if you or another character spend 10 minutes tending to your wounds and restoring your strength. Once you are no longer defeated, your poise momentum and focus are restored to their base values and you are ready to fight again. Being defeated doesn’t inherently carry any penalties. However, any stress and afflictions may linger for days, until you have a chance to recover.</p>

<h3 id="legendary-defiance">Legendary Defiance</h3>
<p>Legendary creatures are tough to take down for long. When a legendary creature is defeated, it can use a point of legendary defiance to stay in the fight. Using legendary defiance also grants the creature several other benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The creature roars, which automatically <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#interrupting-concentration">interrupts</a> all other character’s within earshot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All non-<a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#persistent">persistent</a> <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html">conditions</a> are removed form the creature, as well as the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#reeling">reeling</a>, and <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a> conditions are removed from the creature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creature’s <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#poise">poise</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#momentum">momentum</a>, and <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#focus">focus</a> are set to their base values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some creatures may raise the stakes of the battle in exciting ways after they use a certain amount of legendary defiance!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, you should still savor your victory! When you force a creature to use a point of legendary defiance, you may invoke a <a class = "keyword" href="fate.html#twists-of-fate">twist of fate</a> related to the event for free. For example, you may declare that your attack shredded the dragon’s wing to taters, preventing if from flying and imposing a name on it’s wing attacks.</p>

<p>Each legendary creature has a certain amount of legendary defiance points to use. After the creature has used all of them, you must defeat it one final time to finish it off once and for all!</p>

<h3 id="final-gambit">Final Gambit</h3>

<p>The most deadly warrior is a desperate one. You may invoke a final gambit on your turn, letting you push through any hardship for one last chance at victory. During the round of your final gambit, you gain several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You ignore the effects of the <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#knocked-down">knocked-down</a>, <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#disarmed">disarmed</a>, and <a class = "keyword" href="conditions.html#confused">confused</a> conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can spend as much <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defenses">defense</a> as you want on any <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html">skill</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You ignore any banes on your skills and <a class = "keyword" href="rolls.html">rolls</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You gain a boon on your skills and rolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can move an extra 5 spaces when you use a non-<a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#slow">slow</a> <a class = "keyword" href="skills.html#maneuvers">maneuver</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, pushing your limits comes at a cost. After the round of your final gambit, your remaining defenses are all depleted, you are immediately <a class = "keyword" href="combat.html#defeated">defeated</a>, and you suffer one <a class = "keyword" href="stress.html">stress</a>. NPCs, including minions and legendary creatures, are also capable of final gambits, so never underestimate a foe.</p>
